            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that which obligeth me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my ſelf to you (as to thoſe who alone are fit Judges of it) and to offer you the

Is it not known likewiſe, that our puiſſant Monarch hath this many years entruſted wholly his Sacred Perſon into the hands of him, who through his merits is at preſent the Head of your illuſtrious Body?

            <p>SInce in the Age we live in, we ſee, that moſt people are govern'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Opinion</hi> than <hi>Judgment,</hi> I deſire, that, if you mean to profit by reading my Book, you will reade and examine it without any <hi>critical Envy,</hi> and free from all ſort of <hi>preoccupation,</hi> which may obſcure your Judgment, and hinder you from acknowledging the Truth of thoſe Things I pretend to teach. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be not of their humour who <hi>condemn a Conception</hi> when they <hi>underſtand it not;</hi> and believe it <hi>falſe,</hi> becauſe 'tis <hi>new;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imitate ſuch, who ſeeking alone to carp at <hi>words,</hi> neglect the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: For, even as it happens very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that <hi>Purging,</hi> though proper for a Diſeaſe, doth no good to a Patient, when his Body is not well prepared, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for its Operation: ſo the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:171433:7"/>
Books, which is one of the moſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom effectual Remedies we have to <hi>chaſe</hi> away <hi>ignorance,</hi> is wholly uſeleſs to mens wits, if they are not diſpoſed to receive it. I believe I may hope you will eaſily grant me this requeſt, becauſe it is for your advantage: In the mean time, though I deſign to inſtruct you here in whatſoever concerns <hi>Women with Child,</hi> or <hi>in Labour,</hi> yet I would not divert you from reading of many learned Authors who have treated of it, but only adviſe you that the moſt part of them, having never practiſed the Art they undertake to teach, reſemble (in my opinion) thoſe <hi>Geographers,</hi> who give us the deſcription of many Countries which they never ſaw, and (as they imagine) a perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of them; which makes it very difficult (not to ſay impoſſible) they ſhould ever obtain their end: For it is certain (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath very well noted) that the <hi>ſpeculative</hi> part of Arts is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and unfruitful, when deſtitute of the practice. You may then, as to this ſubject, relye on the Method I ſhow you, ſince, to conduct you in it, I faithfully recite what I have with very happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb facs="tcp:171433:8"/>
obſerved theſe many years in the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Deliveries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, blame me not for being of a Judgement different from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of many; for I declare I have only bound my ſelf to acquaint you with the truth, of which, I hope, you will have more Satisfaction, and be better pleaſed, than if I had always blindly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the thoughts of others; having likewiſe endeavoured, not to extend my ſelf in ſuperfluous diſcourſe, to the end I might be more intelligible to yong <hi>Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,</hi> and <hi>Midwives,</hi> to whom this Book (if I be not miſtaken) will be as uſefull as any, to teach them the ſafe practice of the Art of Deliveries. I have not ſtuft it with a great number of long Receipts, which ſerve only to ſwell a Volumn, and confound their Wits in the uncertainty of the choice of ſo many different Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, compoſed of Drugs which very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten are unknown to them; but ſingly contented my ſelf to teach them the beſt, and principally ſuch as we ordinarily uſe in our practice. But if in all this you find ſome of my Opinions not wholly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, or that others (according to
<pb facs="tcp:171433:8"/>
your Opinion) are not fully agreeing with the Truth; remember, that as amidſt the beſt Corn, there alwayes ſpring Tares, or ſome other Weeds; ſo in like manner you meet with few Books, whoſe doctrine is ſo pure, as not to find ſomething in them to reject: and if I may hope for any reſpect from you in recompence of my pains, it will be but proportionable to what you may have for many others, who never had, in this occaſion, a greater deſire than my ſelf to render you ſervice.</p>

            <p>HAving long obſerved the great want of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary directions how to govern Women with Child and in Childbed, and alſo how new-born Babes ſhould be well ordered, I deſigned a ſmall Manual to that purpoſe, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ing ſometime after in <hi>France</hi> with this Treatiſe of <hi>Mauriceau,</hi> (which, in my opinion, far exceeds all former Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, eſpecially <hi>Culpeper, Sharp, Speculum Matricis, Sermon,</hi> &amp;c. being leſs erronious, and inriched with divers new Obſervations) I changed my reſolution into that of tranſlating him; whom I need not much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, becauſe he is fortified with the approbation of the Wardens of the Chirurgeons Company of <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Anatomy, at the beginning of the Book, I have omitted, there being already ſeverall in Engliſh; as alſo here and there a paſſage that might offend a chaſt Engliſh Eye; and being not abſolutely neceſſary to our purpoſe: the reſt I have, as carefully as I could, rendred into Engliſh for the benefit of our Midwives; ſome of whom may yet very well admit of an additional Knowledge. The principal thing worthy their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in this Book, is, accurately to diſcover what is properly their work, and, when it is neceſſary to ſend for advice and aſſiſtance, that ſo, many Women and Children may be preſerved, that now periſh for
<pb facs="tcp:171433:9"/>
want of ſeaſonable help. My Author marks out the breaking of the right Waters, for the proper ſeaſon of a naturall Delivery, and (when ever a Child is not born thou, or ſoon after) Nature is ſo much ſhort of performing her office. This is certainly a great truth; and all wrong births ſhould never be longer delaied; and for the moſt part Floodings and Convulſions not ſo long, leſt the Woman loſe her life before ever the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter breaks: but if no dangerous Accident intervene, in a right labour, one may lengthen out their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>12</hi> hours after; and, though ſome may have been happily delivered <hi>24</hi> hours, or two dayes after, yet ſhould I not adviſe any to run that hazard, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they can have an expert Phyſician to deliver them, without deſtroying the Child; becauſe many have periſhed in that caſe; and it is not prudent to venture, where but one of many eſcapes: for the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Labour continues after the Watters are broke, the weaker both Woman and Child grow, and the drier her bodie, which renders the birth the more difficult; and 'tis over good taking time by the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And that Midwifes skill is certainly the greatest, and ſhe deſerves moſt commendation, who can ſooneſt diſcover the ſucceſs of the Labour, and accordingly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wait with patience, or timely ſend for advice and help. Nor can it be ſo great a diſcredit to a Midwife (let ſome of them imagine what they pleaſe) to have a Woman or Child ſaved by a Man's aſſiſtance, as to ſuffer either to die under her own hand, although de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered: for, that Midwife miſtakes her office, that thinks ſhe hath performed it, if ſhe do but lay the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; becauſe her principal duty is to take care that ſhe and her Child be well, with ſafety and convenient ſpeed parted; and, if this be impoſſible for her, and
<pb facs="tcp:171433:10"/>
feaſible by another, it will juſtifie her more to wave her imaginary Reputation, and to ſend for help to ſave the Woman and Child, than to let any periſh, when poſſibly to be prevented; As in the caſe of my Author's Siſter in the 20th Chapter of his firſt Book. Yet, in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and places, where help and good advice is not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to be had, Midwives are compelled to do their beſt, as God ſhall enable them; which dangerous and uncertain tryals would not become them to put in practice upon Women, where no timely aſſiſtance need be wanting. Moſt wrong Births, with or without pain; all Floodings with Clods, though little or no pain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at full time, or not: all Convulſions; and many firſt Labours; and ſome others, though the Child be right, if little or no pain, after the breaking of the Waters, and the Child's not following them in ſome ſix or ten houres after, requires the good advice of, and, peradventure ſpeedy delivery by thoſe Phyſicians that are expert in this practice: for, though ſome few may eſcape in theſe caſes, yet far the greater number would periſh, if not aided by them. And let me therefore adviſe good Women, not to be too ready to blame thoſe Midwives skill, who are not backward in dangerous caſes to deſire advice; leſt it coſt them dear by diſcouraging them, and forcing them to preſume beyond their knowledge, or ſtrength especially, there being already but too-too-many over confident.</p>
            <p>Thoſe few things wherein I diſſent from my Author, if of dangerous conſequence, I note in the Margent; if not, I paſſe it by, leaving it to the election of the Reader.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs he is in many places too prolix; a fault that many of the <hi>French</hi> affect; however, I choſe rather to tranſlate him according to his own ſtile,
<pb facs="tcp:171433:10"/>
than contract him; and alſo to leave unaltered ſome things not very well expreſſed, being of no great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I find alſo that he doth not diſtinguiſh between the words <hi>Plaiſter</hi> and <hi>Ointment,</hi> but uſeth them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly one for the other.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>17</hi> Chap. of the ſecond Book, my Author ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the faſtning Hooks in the head of a Child in a difficult Labour, where it comes right; which I confeſſe hath been and is the practice of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Artiſts in Midwifry, not onely in <hi>England,</hi> but throughout <hi>Europe;</hi> and hath very much cauſed the report, that where a man comes, one or both muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily dye; and makes many for that reaſon forbear ſending, untill either be dead or dying. But I can by no means approve of that practice, or thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies; becauſe my Father, Brothers, and my Self, [though none elſe in <hi>Europe</hi> that I know] have by Gods bleſſing, and our induſtry, attained to, and long practiſed a way to deliver a Women in this caſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to her or her Infant; though all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (being reduced, for want of ſuch an expedient, to imploy the common way) do, and muſt endanger, if not deſtroy one or both, by the uſe of theſe Crochets. By this manuell operation we can alſo both ſhorten the time, and leſſen the number of pains in a right Labour, (if there be the least difficulty) without danger, and with advantage to both Woman and Child. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the uſe of Hooks by Phyſicians and Chirurgeons, be condemned (without thereto neceſſitated through ſome monſtrous birth) we can much leſſe approve of a Midwifes uſing them, as ſome here in <hi>England</hi> boaſt they do; which raſh preſumption, in <hi>France</hi> would call them in queſtion for their lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:171433:11"/>In the 15th Chapter of this Book my Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the conveying ſharp Inſtruments into the womb, to extract a head; which is a dangerous operation, and may be much better done by our fore-mentioned Art, as alſo the inconvenience and hazard of a Child dying thereby prevented, which he ſuppoſeth in the 27th Chapter of this 2d Book.</p>
            <p>I will now take leave to offer an Apology for not publiſhing the ſecret I mention we have to extract Children without hooks, where other Artiſts uſe them, which is, that there being my Father and two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers living, that practiſe this Art, I cannot eſteem it my own to diſpoſe of, nor publiſh it without injury to them; and think I have not been unſerviceable to my Country, although I do but inform them that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned three perſons of our family and my ſelf, can ſerve them in theſe extremities with greater ſafety than others.</p>
            <p>The Reader alſo may pleaſe to know that ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations in the Margent, as <hi>lovingly,</hi> p. <hi>6.</hi> and <hi>untimely,</hi> &amp; <hi>unſeaſonably,</hi> p. <hi>22.</hi> with ſome others, were never intended to have been inſerted, but left for the Printer to make choice of the most familiar of them, which (he miſtaking) was, to prevent further trouble, ſuffered to be ſo printed.</p>
            <p>I do not intend this work to incourage any to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe by it, who were not bred up to it; for it will hardly make a Midwife, though it may eaſily mend a bad one. Yet notwithſtanding I do recommend it to the peruſall of all ſuch women as are carefull of their own
<pb facs="tcp:171433:11"/>
and their friends ſafeties, there being many things in it worthy their noting: And deſigning it chiefly for the female ſex, I have not troubled my ſelf to oppoſe or comment upon any Phyſical or Philoſophical Poſition my Author propoſeth. I hope no good Midwives will blame me or my Author for reprehending the fault of bad ones, who are onely aimed at, and admoniſhed in this work; and I am confident none but the guilty will be concerned, and take it to themſelves, which I deſire they may, and amend.</p>

It is not my deſign ſo to enlarge as to examine all, but onely to enquire into the principal and moſt uſual Maladies that accompany Great-Bellies, and have, during their courſe, ſome particular Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for their Cure; for as for thoſe which have only general Indications, and may happen indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to a Woman at any time, they may eaſily be known and redreſſed by the ordinary means, provided that you have all the while regard to the diſpoſition of the Great-Belly.</p>

the explication of a Conception, which muſt precede it: but, ſince that cannot happen but to a fruitfull Woman, I will, before I diſcourſe of it, that you may the better underſtand it from its original, give you ſome conſiderable Obſervations concerning the Fruitfulneſs and Barrenneſs of Women; for Barrenneſs proceeds oftner from Women than Men: for there are many conditions required in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which Men have no occaſion of, who only need to provide a ſmall quantity of their Seed, and that at once, to generate; but Women, beſides their Seed, muſt have a fit place to receive both, as the Womb is when well diſpoſed; and matter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Child's nouriſhment, during its whole ſtay there, as is the menſtruous blood: This is the cauſe, that for one impotent Man, there may be above thirty barren Women found. Let us therefore firſt of all ſee what are the ſigns of Fruitfulneſs and Barrenneſs in Women.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the ſigns of Fertility and Sterility in Women.</head>
               <p>By the <hi>Fertility</hi> of a Woman, I underſtand a natural diſpoſition of her Body, by means of which, with the aſſiſtance of a Man, ſhe may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender her like: And by <hi>Sterility,</hi> which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary, I intend an<note n="*" place="margin">Incapacity.</note> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, which proceeds from ſome vice or fault either of her whole body, or of ſome particular part. We muſt how
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:171433:13"/>
make ſome enquiries after the moſt notable ſigns of the one and the other, and chiefly of thoſe which may be perceived by our ſight or touch, by which we may better judge than by many others, that for the moſt part are uncertain: For thoſe which are taken from different temperaments, may eaſily deceive us, foraſmuch as we may often find Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of a very ill habit, and full of ill humours, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding fruitful.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore, we affirm the Womb to be a part abſolutely neceſſary to fertility, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal object to be repreſented and examined to make a judgment of it: but as we find not every Ground proper to yeeld Fruit, and that ſome are ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to produce nothing; ſo likewiſe it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for a Woman to have a Womb to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Conception, ſince we find divers that have them, barren.</p>
               <p>We have already<note n="*" place="margin">In his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy not yet printed</note> ſhewed you exactly what the compoſition and natural ſtructure of it ought to be, for to ſerve to ſo admirable an end as generation: Wherefore we will now ſpeak no further of that, but refer you to that place to be informed.</p>
               <p>You muſt know then in general that the ſigns of fecundity in a Women are, that her Womb be well diſpoſed, that ſhe be at leaſt thirteen or fourteen years of age, and at moſt but 45 or 50 generally and for the moſt part (though ſome, yet very rarely, conceive ſooner or later according to their different natures and diſpoſitions) that they be of a good temperament and indifferently ſanguine, that they have their Courſes in due time, of good blood and laudable in coulour, quantity, quality, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and regularly every month, at once, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171433:14"/>
interruption, from the time they begin to flow till the time the evacuation is compleated.</p>
               <p>We ſay that the bloud ought to be good and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, becauſe it is a regurgitation and natural eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation only of what is ſuperfluous in Women not with Child, and yet of age capable of Conception; which hath no malignity in it ſelf, as many falſly imagine: for in healthful women it hardly differs either in colour, conſiſtence, or quality from that which remains in the veſſels, except in the ſmall alteration, which is cauſed by the heat of the place whence it proceeds, and by the mixture of ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours with which the womb is alwayes plentifully furniſht.</p>
               <p>This evacuation (if in order) ought to be every month but once, though ſome have them every fourtnight, or at the end of three weeks, according as they are more or leſs ſanguine, or cholerick, or have their blood heated: and to continue two or three days together, or ſix at moſt, and that by little and little, conſtant without interruption, and alſo more or leſs according to the difference of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular temperaments. If a Woman have few of them, as when ſhe grows in years, ſhe becomes bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, foraſmuch as this blood ſeems to nouriſh the Child in the Womb: and likewiſe if ſhe have too many, becauſe the Woman thereby grows too weak and the Womb too cold. There are notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Women who void more of them in two days, than others in eight. They muſt flow by little and little without interruption, and not all at once; for great and ſudden evacuations cauſe great diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirits, of which abundance are neceſſary for generation; and the interruption of theſe evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171433:14"/>
ſhews ſome impediment in nature, or ſome vice or evil diſpoſition of the Womb.</p>
               <p>If all theſe ſigns concur, we may very probably judge the Woman fruitful; I ſay probably, becauſe there are many who have them all, and yet cannot conceive, though they do their endeavours, and obſerve thereto all the requiſite and neceſſary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which we ſhall hereafter mention: There are likewiſe others, who, notwithſtanding they have not all theſe conditions, are fruitful. Now if all the above named patticulars are found in a Woman that is barren, and that you deſire to inquire more narrowly, and to be informed more certainly whether ſhe be capable of conception, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth a way to know it, to which I give little credit, becauſe the reaſons of it are very obſcure. It is in his 59 <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> of his 5th Book, where he ſaith, <hi>Si mulier non concipiat, &amp; ſcire pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet an ſit conceptura, veſtibus undique obvolutam ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuffito: ac ſi odor corpus pervadere videatur, ad nares &amp; os uſque, non ſua culpa ſterilem eſſe ſcito.</hi> If a Woman doth not conceive, and you are deſirous to know whether ſhe is capable, or no; wrap her cloſe round with clothes, and put a perfume under her; and if ſhe perceive the ſent to paſs through her body to her noſe and mouth, be aſſured (ſaith he) it is not her fault ſhe is barren.</p>
               <p>Fertility was anciently ſo eſteemed by our fore-fathers, that they believed Barrenneſs to be a mark of reprobation; by reaſon of which the fruitfull Servant deſpiſed her barren Miſtreſs; as we reade in the 16th Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where mention is made of <hi>Sarai, Abraham</hi>'s Wife, who, ſeeing that ſhe could have no Children, and being paſt the age
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171433:15"/>
of hoping for any, and that her Husband was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at it, bid him take her Aegyptian Chamber-maid, named <hi>Agar,</hi> to lie with him, that by her means the might give him lineage, which good Father <hi>Abraham</hi> quickly did, and had by her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a Son, which was called <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> but from the time this Maid had conceived, ſhe began to deſpiſe her Miſtreſs <hi>Sarai,</hi> who was as yet barren. The Women of our times are not ſo earneſt to have lineage after this faſhion, there being but few that will ſuffer their Husbands to careſs their Chamber-maids, much leſs<note n="*" place="margin">Lovingly.</note> charitably to excite them to follow this example, which cuſtom is aboliſhed amongſt us.</p>
               <p>I alſo admire the great paſſion which many have, who complain of nothing with greater regret than to the without Children, eſpecially without Sons. For my part, I believe they that deſcend from <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> or the Family of <hi>Bourbons,</hi> may with ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be led away with this ſuperſtitious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon inclination of preſerving their kind, and be vexed with theſe ſorts of inquietudes, which no wayes become ordinary people; though excuſable, and may be permitted to great Monarchs and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious men.</p>
               <p>When we perfectly underſtand the natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, we may the eaſier diſcern thoſe contrary to nature; wherefore the ſigns of fruitfulneſs eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach us thoſe of barrenneſs. The ſigns and cauſes of barrenneſs proceed either from the age, or evil temperature and vicious conformation of the Womb, and parts depending on it, or the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and intemperature of the whole habit. The evil conformation of the Womb renders Women
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:171433:15"/>
barren, when its neck (called the <hi>Vagina</hi>) is ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that it cannot give way to penetration; and when it is wholly or in part cloſed by ſome external or internal membrane, (which is very rare, if at all) or by any tumour, calloſity, or cicatrice, which may hinder the Woman from the free uſe of copulation.</p>
               <p>But it is not ſufficient that the Man's Yard enter the <hi>Vagina,</hi> which is the anti-chamber to the Womb: for, if in the act of copulation, he knocks at the door, which is the internal orifice, and it be not opened, all is to no purpoſe. This orifice is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hindred from opening by ſome calloſity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from abundance of ill humours, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſlow down from the Matrix, or by ſome tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which may happen to it; or alſo, by ſome part, which may ſo compreſs it, that it cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to receive the Seed, as doth the <hi>Epiploon</hi> (or cawl) in fat Women, according to the opinion of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> in his 46th Aphoriſm of his 5th Book, where he ſaith, <hi>Quae praeier naturam craſſae, non concipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, iis os uteri ab omento comprimitur, &amp; priuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam extenuentur, non concipiunt.</hi> Women ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fat do not conceive, becauſe the Cawl com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the orifice of their Womb, neither can they till they grow lean. I do not willingly admit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the cauſes of barrenneſs, this compreſſion of the inward orifice by the <hi>Epiploon,</hi> foraſmuch as <hi>Aritin</hi> hath very well remedied it, by ſome of the poſtures invented by him, by which this orifice need not be ſo compreſſed in the action.</p>
               <p>The moſt frequent reaſon why this orifice opens not in this act to receive the Man's Seed, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility of ſome Women, who take no pleaſure in the venerial act; but when they have an appetite,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:171433:16"/>
the Womb deſirous and covetous of the Seed, at that inſtant opens it ſelf to receive it, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with it. But though the <hi>Vagina,</hi> or neck of the Womb, and the inward orifice opens to give paſſage to the Seed; yet may they very often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue barren, if the ſcituation of this orifice be not rightly placed, but either backwards towards the<note n="*" place="margin">Great, or right Gut.</note> 
                  <hi>Inteſtin rectum,</hi> or towards either ſide; all which hinders the Man from<note n="†" place="margin">ſhooting.</note> darting his Seed directly into it, and conſequently the Woman from conceiving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeems to have noted all the ſigns and cauſes of barrenneſs, which uſually proceed from the evil temper of the Womb, in his 62 Aphoriſm of the 5th Book, where he ſaith, <hi>Quae frigidos &amp; denſos habent uteros, non concipiunt, &amp; quae praehu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midos habent uteros, non concipiunt: extinguitur enim in ipſis genitura. Et quae plus aequo ſiccos &amp; adurentes: Nam alimenti defectu ſemen corrumpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Quae vero ex utriſque nactae ſunt moderatam temperiem, eae faecundae evadunt.</hi> All ſuch Women whoſe Womb is cold and cloſe, cannot conceive; nor they who have it too moiſt: becauſe the Seed is extinguiſhed in it. And likewiſe ſuch who have it too dry and hot; becauſe, for want of aliment the Seed corrupts: but ſuch as are of a moderate temperament are fruitful. Of all theſe which <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> recites in this Aphoriſm, the moſt common, according to my opinion, is the continual Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Womb, fed by an abundance of the Whites, with which many are very much incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venienced, the humours of the whole Body being accuſtomed to ſteer their courſe this way, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:171433:16"/>
can very hardly be turned away when inveterate, and the Womb being imbued with theſe vicious moiſtures, becomes inwardly ſo unctuous and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, that the Seed (though viſcous and glutinous) cannot cleave to it, nor be retained within it, which is the cauſe that it ſlips immediatly away, or in ſome ſhort time after it is received.</p>
               <p>Barrenneſs may alſo proceed from the whole ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Body, as when a Woman is too old, or too young: for the Seed of the young is not yet prolifick, neither have they the menſtruous blood; which two things are requiſit to fruitfulneſs: and that of the aged is in too ſmall a quantity, and too cold, who likewiſe want the menſtruous blood. An univerſal intemperature (though the Woman be of convenient years) renders them however bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, as it happens when they are hectick, hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, feaveriſh and ſickly, and eſpecially ſo much the more as the noble parts are fallen from their temperament and natural conſtitution: There are however many Women which ſeem barren for a long time, becauſe of ſome of the fore-mentioned Reaſons, yea, till they are thirty five or forty years old, and ſometimes longer, who yet at laſt conceive, being cured of the indiſpoſitions which hindred them, and having changed their tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by their age, of which we have had a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable example in the perſon of Queen-mother, lately deceaſed, who was above two and twenty years married, and without Children, and yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to the great joy and content of all <hi>France,</hi> ſhe had our invincible Monarch <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14th, now reigning, to whom God grant a long and happy life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:171433:17"/>Some of theſe Barrenneſſes may ſometimes be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by removing their cauſes, and procuring the diſpoſitions we have ſaid are neceſſary to fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yea, of thoſe which proceed from an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal intemperament, by reducing the Body with a good and convenient regimen to a good order, and this according to their reſpective indiſpoſitions. Wherefore if a Woman have naturally the <hi>Vagina</hi> too narrow, and not from ſome of the cauſes above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, ſhe ought to be joyned to a Man whoſe Member is proportionable, if poſſible: and if that will not do, (which happens very ſeldom) ſhe muſt endeavour to relax it and dilate it with emolient Oyls and Oyntments; if the neck of the Womb be compreſſed by any humour, it muſt be reſolved and ſuppurated according to its nature and ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having alwayes care to prevent the corruption of theſe parts, which being hot and moiſt, are very ſubject to it; becauſe the womb ſerves as a ſink by which all the ill humours of the body are purged; ſo that you muſt take great care, that theſe kind of Tumours turn not to a Cancer, which is a very miſchievous malady, and cauſeth the poor Women miſerably to languiſh which are afflicted with it, and which after many inſupportable pains, brings them almoſt alwayes to an inevitable death.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Vagina</hi> is not clear in its capacity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of any ſcar after a rent, cauſed by ſome force or violence to the Woman, or of ſome hard labour, or after an ulcer which cauſed the two ſides to be agglutinated, whether inwardly or outwardly, it muſt be ſeparated the beſt that may be with a<note n="*" place="margin">A kind of large Inciſion-knife.</note> 
                  <hi>Biſtory,</hi> or ſome other Inſtrument, according as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:171433:17"/>
the caſe requires, hindring, by interpoſed Linnen, that it do not again agglutinate.</p>
               <p>When a Woman hath no <hi>Vulva,</hi> or outward entry of the Womb pierced, which is very rare, it muſt be opened by making a long Inciſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fabricius</hi> recites the like caſe in a Girl of thirteen years of age, who was like to die of it, becauſe her Terms could not come down, there being no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foration, wherefore he did the like operation, which ſucceeded very well, and made her by that means capable of generation. As to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward orifice of the Womb, if it be diſplaced either towards the back or ſides, it may be in ſome ſort remedied, by making the Woman to obſerve, in the act of generation, a convenient poſture, that the Man's Seed may be ejaculated towards the orifice; and if the Whites, or other Impurities of the Womb cauſe barrenneſs, as it is for the moſt part by the diſcharge of the whole habit on this place; it muſt be helped by Evacuations, Purgations, and a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diet, according to their different cauſes, and qualities of theſe ill humours.</p>
               <p>Having thus diſcovered the moſt certain ſigns of Fertility, and the marks of Sterility, I will now (the better to purſue the order I have propoſed) treat of Conception.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of Conception, and the conditions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for it.</head>
               <p>IT is moſt certain, according to the Rule of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that a Woman is incapable of conceiving, if ſhe have not the conditions requiſit for fruitfulneſs: we have mentioned them in the foregoing chapter: let us now examine in this, what is Conception, and how it is cauſed. Conception is nothing elſe, but an action of the Womb, by which the prolifick ſeeds of the Man and Woman are there received and retained, that an infant may be engendred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of it. There are two ſorts of Conceptions; the one true, according to Nature, to which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the generation of the Infant in the Womb: the other falſe, which we may ſay is wholly againſt Nature, and there the ſeeds change into water, falſe-conceptions, moles, or any other ſtrange matter.</p>
               <p>The qualifications requiſit, for a Woman to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive according to Nature, are, that the Woman receive and retain in her Womb the Mans and her own prolifick ſeed, without which it cannot come to paſs; for it is neceſſary that both ſeeds ſhould be there; nor is it at all true, what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and ſome other of his followers affirm, that the Woman neither hath nor can yeeld any ſeed, a great abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to believe: for the contrary may eaſily be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, by ſeeing the Spermatick Veſſels and Teſticles of a fruitful Woman, appointed for this uſe, which are wholly filled with this ſeed, which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:171433:18"/>
in coition they diſcharge as well as Men. Such a will not open their eyes to behold a verity ſo clear, may make reflection on the reſemblance of Infants to their Mother, which could not be unleſs her ſeed had been more praedominant than the Fathers, when he begot them; which likewiſe happens after the ſame manner when the Fathers hath more force and vertue. Which may evince, that the Womens ſeed contributes as well to the formation of the Infant as the Fathers. If they will not agree to a thing ſo common, let them make another reflection on the generation of certain Animals, which participate of the nature of the Male and Female (of which they are engendred) though of different kind; as we daily ſee Aſſes and Mares produce by their coupling Mules, which are Animals of a middle nature reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling both the one and the other, that produced them. We may then learn by this, that both Seeds are neceſſary for a true Conception, provided they be prolifick, that is, containing in them the Idea of all the parts of the body, and then the Womb being greedy of it, delights it ſelf in it, and eaſily retains it when received, elſe it ſoon afterwards rejects it.</p>
               <p>It is not abſolutely neceſſary, that both the Seeds be received and retained intire, without the loſs of ſome part; for, provided there be a moderate quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it, 'tis ſufficient: Nor muſt we imagin, that (though all of it be not received into the Womb) the Child, formed out of it, will want ſome limb, as an arm, a leg, or other member, for want of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient matter: inaſmuch as the forming faculty is whole in every part of the Seed, of which the leaſt drop contains in it potentially the idea and form of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:171433:19"/>
all the parts, as we have lately made appear: but indeed when the Seeds are received but in ſmall quantity, the Child may be the leſs &amp; weaker for it: Or if either or both of them have not the requiſit qualities; or, though well enough conditioned, if the Womb be imbued and ſtuft with ill humours, as the menſtrues, whites, and other filth, or any other fault; if then there be a conception, it will be contrary to Nature, and there will be ingendred falſe births, Moles, or dropſies of the Womb, mixed with ſome other ſtrange bodies, which are very troubleſome to Women, till they void them.</p>
               <p>It is therefore without cauſe, that many Women are blamed, when their children are born with red and livid ſpots, which very much disfigure the faces of ſome of them: It is uſually ſaid (but without reaſon) that this proceeds from the mothers longing to drink Wine; for, though ſome have, by chance, been in effect harraſſed (as they affirm) with theſe paſſionate deſires during their being with child, yet we muſt not ſuperſtitiouſly believe (as many do) that theſe ſpots are ſo cauſed, but rather from ſome other cauſe, which muſt be ſearcht for elſewhere: And that which makes it appear, it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from hence, is, that almoſt throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> where nothing but white wine is drunk, as alſo in <hi>Anjou</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> I have ſeen divers perſons marked with theſe red ſpots: and in caſe it proceeded from their Mothers longing to drink Wine, they ought to be white ſpots, or of an Amber colour, being the colour of the wine of theſe Countries: but we ought rather to conclude that they are cauſed, from ſome extravaſated blood, at the time the Infant is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which marks the skin, yet very tender with theſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:171433:19"/>
ſpots, and colours it in whatſoever part it toucheth, much after the ſame manner as we ſee it marked with Gunpouder, or ſome waters producing the like effect when it is waſht and bathed with them. I will not however deny that the imagination hath a power to imprint on the body of the Infant, marks of this nature; but that can only be when young with Child, and principally at the very moment of conception; for when the Child is compleatly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the imagination can in no wiſe change its firſt figure, and Women muſt wean themſelves from theſe vain apprehenſions, which they ſay they have to ſuch things (every moment) and ſerves ſome of them for a pretext to cover their liquoriſhneſs.</p>
               <p>Since my diſcourſe is fallen upon this ſubject of Marks, with which oft times the bodies of Infants are ſpoted in their birth, and which comes, as is ordinarily believed, from the imagination of their Mother, it ſeems to me not much from my purpoſe, to recite you a circumſtance very particular ſound on Me, when I came into the world, as my Father and Mother have often told me, which is, that my Mother being with Child of me, and almoſt at the end of her reckoning, as it appear'd afterwards, the eldeſt of her three Sons (which ſhe then had of ſix years old, and her firſt-born, whom ſhe loved with an extraordinary tenderneſs and paſſion) dyed in ſeven dayes of the ſmall Pox, all which time ſhe continned night and day by his bed ſide tending him in all his neceſſities, not ſuffering any other to do it, whatſoever deſires were made to her, not to weary and trouble her ſelf, as ſhe did, for the Childs ſickneſs, alledging that in her preſent condition, ſhe ought to be careful of her ſelf, and not be the cauſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:171433:20"/>
of death to the Infant ſhe went with; in fine, at the end of ſeven dayes her Son dyed, upon which the next day ſhe was delivered of me, who brought effectively into the world with me ſix or ſeven of the ſmall Pox. Now it is certain, that it would be irrational to ſay, that I had then contracted theſe ſmall Pox in my Mothers Womb, by her ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination: But if I were asked whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded? I ſhould anſwer, that the contagious air ſhe breathed without diſcontiuuance, during the whole ſickneſs of her deceaſed Son, had ſo infected the maſs of her blood, with which at that time I was nouriſhed, that I, rather than ſhe, eaſily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the impreſſion of this contagion, becauſe of the tenderneſs of my body. Let us therefore aſſert, that the imagination cannot produce any of the above mentioned effects, but at the moment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or within few dayes after, and that we ought for the moſt part to ſearch elſewhere (if we deſire the truth of it) the cauſe of moſt of theſe Spots, Marks, and Signes with which many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are born.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III</hi> Of the Signs of Conception.</head>
               <p>AS it is very hard and belonging only to expert Gardeners to know Plants as ſoon as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſpring forth of the Earth; ſo likewiſe there are none but expert<note n="*" place="margin">Chirurgeons onely practiſe Midwifery in France.</note> Chirurgeons can give a Woman certain aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Conception from its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: although ſome of theſe ſigns, reſembling thoſe of the ſuppreſſion of the Terms and other maladies in Women, cauſe many to be deceived in it.</p>
               <p>I will not trouble my ſelf to make a recital of a great number of ſigns of conception, which rather tend to ſuperſtition, than an effective verity: but only the moſt eſſential and ordinary, by which a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon may be aſſured of it; of which ſome may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be perceived, others not till afterwards. He ſhall firſt examine and inform himſelf, whether the Woman hath all or moſt part of the ſigns of fertility, which are already named in the diſcourſe of them, if not, he muſt impute them to ſome other cauſe; and ſuppoſing ſhe be fruitful, you may then know whether ſhe have conceived, by their agreement, and more then ordinary delight in the act.</p>
               <p>It is not enough for a Woman to be certain ſhe hath conceived, and to yeeld and receive her ſeed with the Mans into her Womb, unleſs it cloſe at that inſtant, and retain it. There is an Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the cuſtoms of <hi>Paris,</hi> in which it is ſaid,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:171433:21"/>
                  <hi>that to give and keep is not good:</hi> but it is not ſo in Conception; for a Woman gives and caſts her Seed into her Womb, and there retains it. She may know whether ſhe retains the Seeds, if ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives nothing flow down from the Womb after Copulation: The Woman ſome few months after perceives alſo ſome ſmall pain about her Navel, and ſome little commotions in the bottom of her Belly, cauſed by the Womb's cloſing it ſelf to retain the Seeds, and contracting it ſelf ſo as to leave no em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty ſpace, the better to contain them, and embrace them the cloſer. The light pain of the Navel comes from the Blader of the Urine (from the bottom of which proceeds the <hi>Urachus,</hi> which is faſtened to the Navel) which is a little agitated by that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and kind of motion that happens to the Womb, when it is cloſed to retain the Seeds, and from the like agitation comes alſo thoſe little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of the Belly.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſigns of Conceptions, which may be known at the moment they happen, and may be yet more certainly known if you perceive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Orifice exactly cloſe. Beſides theſe ſigns, there are others which cannot be known till ſome time after, as when the Woman begins to have loathings, having no other Diſtemper, loſeth her appetite to meats which ſhe did love: longs to eate ſtrange things, to which ſhe was not accuſtomed, which happens according to the quality of the humours predominating in her, and with which her ſtomach abounds: She hath often nauſeatings and vomitings, which continue a long time: the Tearms ſtopping, no other cauſe appearing, having alwayes before been in good order: her Breaſts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:171433:21"/>
ſwell, wax hard, and cauſe pain, from the flowing of the blood and humours to them, wanting their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary evacuation, their upper parts are firmer and larger, becauſe of the repletion; the Navel ſtarts: her Nipples are very obſcure or dark coloured, with a yellowiſh livid circle round about: her Eyes are dejected and hollow, the whites of them dull and troubled: her blood, when ſhe hath conceived ſome time, is alwayes bad, becauſe the ſuperfluities of it not being then purged, as accuſtomed, is altered and corrupted by their mixture. Moreover, there is a ſign, which all the Women eſteem and hold in this doubtful caſe for very certain, which is, <hi>en ventre plat enfant y a,</hi> in a flat Belly there is a Child. Indeed there is rime in this proverb, and ſomething of reaſon, but not as they imagin, that the Womb cloſing it ſelf after Conception draws in a manner the Belly inwards and flatten's it, which cannot be; becauſe the Womb free and wavering, not faſtened forwards to the Belly, whereby to draw it back after that manner: but it may poſſibly be by reaſon that Women grow lean by the indiſpoſitions of their pregnancy, and wax thinner and ſmaller, not only in their Belly, but alſo throughout their whole body, as may be known the two firſt months of their pregnancy, during which time that which is contained in the Womb, is yet very ſmall; but when the Womans blood begins to flow to it in abundance, then the Belly waxeth daily bigger and bigger afterwards, until her reckoning be out.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſigns concurring in a Woman who hath uſed copulation, or the moſt part of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and ſucceſſively, according to their ſeaſons;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:171433:22"/>
we may paſs our judgment, that ſhe hath conceived, notwithſtanding that many of them may happen upon the ſuppreſſion of the Terms, which uſually produce the like: for every one knows, that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth alſo in Virgins, diſguſts, nauſeatings and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, but not ſo frequently; the ſwelling, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and pains of the breaſts, as alſo extravagant appetites, a livid colour of the Eyes, and others, to which you muſt have regard. The Matrix may be yet exactly cloſe, and the Woman not conceived: Yea there are ſome, in whom they almoſt never open, unleſs very little to give paſſage to the Tearms; which happens to ſome naturally, to others by accident, as by ſome calloſity proceeding from an Ulcer, or other malady.</p>
               <p>If all theſe ſignes of Conception (which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may deceive us, though rarely, if they concur together) do not give us a ſufficient aſſurance of it, and that we deſire a better, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth us a way to know it, which I believe to be no more certain than the reſt: it is in his 42<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Aphoriſm of his 5th Book; where he ſpeaks in this ſort, <hi>Si ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis noſcere, an conceperit mulier, dormiturae, aquam mulſam potui dato: &amp; ſi ventris tormina patiatur, concepit; ſin minus, non concepit:</hi> If you deſire to know whether a Woman hath conceived or no, give her, going to reſt, a draught of Metheglin; and if afterwards ſhe feels pains in her Belly, cauſed by wind ſhe hath conceived; if none, ſhe hath not, as he ſaith. Which is grounded (as I believe) upon the ſuppoſition that Metheglin breeds wind, which cannot paſs eaſily downwards, becauſe the Womb (being full) compreſſeth with its greatneſs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:171433:22"/>
the<note n="*" place="margin">The great Gut.</note> 
                  <hi>Inteſtin rectum,</hi> on which it is ſcituated, and cauſeth thoſe winds to rumble, which are conſtrained to recoyl back into the other Inteſtines.</p>
               <p>If there be any occaſion where Phyſicians or Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons ought to be more prudent, and to make more reflections upon their Prognoſticks for an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair ſo important as this is, it is in this which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns their Judgments as to conception and Womens being with child, to avoid the great accidents and misfortunes, which they cauſe who are too precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in it without a certain knowledge. The faults which are committed through too much fear at ſuch a time, are in ſome ſort excuſable and to be pardoned; but not thoſe cauſed by temerity, which are incomparably greater. There are but too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor Women who have been cauſed to miſcarry by Medicines and bleeding, not beleiving they were with Child, which are ſo many murders they are guilty of who cauſed it, either through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or raſhneſs: beſides the death which they bring to thoſe little innocent creatures, by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in their Mothers belly, they often there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by put the Mothers into great danger. We have lately had in <hi>Paris,</hi> in the year 1666, a miſerable example of this kind, in a Woman hanged, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards publickly diſſected, near the Kitchen-Court of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> who was found four months gone with Child, notwithſtanding the report of ſuch perſons as had viſited her by the Judges Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before her Execution, who affirmed, contrary to the Truth, that ſhe was not with Child. That which deceived them was, the Woman's having ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually her Courſes, though with Child. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:171433:23"/>
'tis not good to be too confident, foraſmuch as there are many with Child who have their Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and I have known ſome who have had them all the time of their Great-Belly till the fifth or ſixth month, which happens according to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans being more or leſs ſanguine; though the greateſt number uſually have them not: but there are very few general rules, which may not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be excepted againſt.</p>
               <p>This accident made ſuch a noiſe in <hi>Paris,</hi> that it quickly came to the knowledge of the King and all his Court, who very much blamed thoſe perſons, that by their ignorance had cauſed the<note n="*" place="margin">Untimely or unſeaſonable.</note> precipitated Execution of this poor unfortunate Creature, with whom periſhed the Infant, innocent of the Mothers crimes. Nor muſt the Chirurgeon much truſt to what theſe ſort of Women may tell him concerning it, for, being afraid of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their crime, to delay it, do almoſt all ſay they are with child, which is a reaſon very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, why the perſons, to whom ſuch matters are committed, ſhould be very knowing. There are yet another ſort of Women, who having been ill treated, ſend for the Chirurgeon that he may give them a Certificate, the better to be revenged on their adverſary; which that they may the eaſier obtain, they alſo affirm themſelves with child, and having received blowes on their Belly, feign that they find their great pain, and if by chance they have at that time their Courſes, they endeavour to perſwade that it is a flooding, or ſhowes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt be careful not to be deceived: and yet, that he may not be eſteemed ignorant, nor fall into
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:171433:23"/>
the like diſgrace, when there is any cauſe of doubt, it is better to delay a little, then raſhly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his prognoſtick at a venture; for as there are Women, who would be thought to be with Child, though they are not; ſo there are others who will deny it, till they are brought to bed, as in this following example. About the year 1654, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Citty of <hi>Saumur,</hi> there was near my Lodging a young and very handſom Daughter of a Citizen, who was five whole months under a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician's and Apothecaries hands, to be cured of a Dropſie which ſhe complained of: at length after ſhe had taken many violent Remedies they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her, ſhe was cured in a moment, by bringing forth a Child at its full time, notwithſtanding all they had given her; which much aſtoniſhed the Phyſician and Apothecary, who were ſo groſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, in truſting to the Maids relation, who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited the Dropſie ſo well, that they could never perceive the truth till ſhe was brought to bed.</p>
               <p>Some Women themſelves are deceived in their being with Child, as lately the Wife of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour of the Court, who after having been in a courſe of Phyſick of ſix or ſeven whole months for the Dropſie, under an eminent Phyſician, was at length brought to bed of a Child.</p>
               <p>I knew another Woman, a Merchant of Squared-Timber at <hi>Paris,</hi> who never had a Child, though ſhe ſo paſſionately deſired it, as to be at the point of hoping for one at 55 years of age, under the colour that ſhe had ſtill her Courſes. This Woman was once perſwaded (upon the recital of ſuch ſigns as ſhe ſaid ſhe had) for the ſpace of ten whole months, that ſhe was with Child, of which the Midwife and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:171433:24"/>
many others aſſured her, and ſhe her ſelf likewiſe believed it (for it is eaſie to be perſwaded to believe what one hopes for with a ſtrong paſſion) ſhe had a big-belly, and ſaid alſo that ſhe felt the Child ſtir; and believed it ſo truly, that finding her ſelf one day worſe than ordinarily (after having prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very fine neceſſaries for the Child ſhe imagined ſhe went with) ſhe ſent for the Midwife, who when ſhe was come, aſſured her it was her Labour: but the next day (having alwayes till then expected a Child) ſhe voided only a quantity of Water, with ſome Wind from the Womb, and nothing elſe: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which ſhe was forced to fold up her fine Toilets again which ſhe had provided. By theſe Examples we may learn not to be too ready to rely upon Womens Relations, if there be no other Reaſon, which may be known by the Examination of the Signs already declared.</p>
               <p>Now ſince after Conception (of which we have juſt done ſpeaking) there follows Generation, let us conſider what it is, and how it is performed.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> What Generation is, and what is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to it.</head>
               <p>IT is a very great Truth, and generally known, That whatſoever is in this lower World, is ſubject to corruption, and at length conſtrained to ſuffer death: which hath obliged Nature, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and careful of its preſervation, to endue all things with a certain deſire of eternizing themſelves,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:171433:24"/>
which not being poſſible in individuals, becauſe mortal by an indiſpenſible neceſſity, is therefore done by the propagation of their forms and kinds. She obtains her end, in reſpect of Animals, by the means of Generation ſucceſſively reiterated: for ſo all creatures ſeem to immortalize themſelves, in ſome ſenſe, by producing their like. And Fathers imagin themſelves not quite dead, if they leave their like behind them after their death, to wit, their Children.</p>
               <p>By Generation, we underſtand generally, a progreſs of that which is, to that which is not. But this definition is a little too ample for to come to the knowledge of what we deſire concerning the generation of perfect Animals, and chiefly of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; wherefore that our intention may be the eaſier conceived, we muſt ſearch ſome other, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a deſcription, which may more exactly diſcover the thing: to this purpoſe we ſay that by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Mankind, we mean a proper and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular action of the Womb; by which working upon both ſeeds there retained, it forms and ſhapes a body out of them, compoſed of divers parts, which it diſpoſeth in order, to become in time the Organ of the Soul, which muſt be infuſed into it. There are many things requiſit to make the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration perfect, without which it would be wholly and abſolutely impoſſible: there are uſually three principally reckoned, to wit, diverſity of ſex, their congreſſion, and the mixture of both Seeds, which we will a little particularly examine. Although ſome define a Woman to be an Animal which can engender in it ſelf, and that this may be true; yet it is moſt certain, that ſhe cannot engender without
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:171433:25"/>
a Man that hath diſcharg'd his Seed into her womb. And though we daily ſee Pullets have Eggs, and other Fowl, without the Cocks treading them, yet of thoſe Eggs there will never come Chickens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Male never had made an impreſſion on them, nor given them this prolifick vertue, which is abſolutely neceſſary to this purpoſe. This may convince us that diverſity of ſex is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit, as well to thoſe Animals, as to the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is Man.</p>
               <p>Diverſity of ſex would profit little, if copulation did not likewiſe follow; though ſome ſubtile Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to cloak their ſhameleſneſs, would perſwade one that they were never touch'd by any Man who could get them with Child, as ſhe of whom <hi>Averroes</hi> ſpeaks, who conceived in a Bath in which a Man had waſht himſelf a little before, and had caſt forth his Seed into it, which was drawn and ſuckt in (as he ſaith) by the Womb of this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: but this is a ſtory fit to amuſe little children.</p>
               <p>Now to the end theſe different ſexes ſhould be obliged to come to this touch, which we call Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, beſides the deſire of begetting their like, which naturally incites them to it, the parts of Men and Women deſtined to Generation, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a delightful and mutual itch, to ſtir them up to the action, without which it would be impoſſible for a Man (ſo divine an Animal) born for the contemplation of heavenly things, to joyn himſelf to a Woman, in regard of the unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the parts, and of the act. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; If Women did but think of a thouſand pains and inconveniences which their great Bellies cauſe them, of the pains they endure, and the hazard
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:171433:25"/>
of their lives when they are in labour, to which may be added the loſs of their beauty, which is the moſt precious gift they have, and which makes them be beloved by thoſe that poſſeſs them, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it might alſo afright them from it: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other make theſe reflections till after the action (whence comes the ſaying, <hi>Poſt coitum omne animal triſte</hi>) conſidering nothing before but the mutual pleaſure they receive by it. It is then from this voluptuous Itch, and the deſire of begetting their like, that Nature obligeth both theſe ſexes to this congreſſion.</p>
               <p>As to the mixture of both ſeeds; it is certain that the diverſity of ſexes and their congreſſion, are but for this end, without which Generation cannot be; though ſome would have Womens ſeed ſerve to no purpoſe; yea, that they neither have any, nor eject any, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith: but we have proved the contrary in the Chapter of Conception, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of daily experience, to which you may have recourſe, to avoid repetition.</p>
               <p>All theſe three Circumſtances, to wit, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of ſexes, their congreſſion, and the mixture of their matters, which is called Seeds, muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Conception, to which ſucceeds Generation, on this faſhion: As ſoon as the Woman hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that is, hath received and retained in her Womb the two prolifick ſeeds, it is every way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to imbrace them cloſely, and is ſo exactly cloſed, that the point of a Needle (as ſaith <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>) cannot enter it without violence; after which it reduceth by its heat, from power into action, the ſeveral faculties, which are in the ſeeds it contains, making uſe of the Spirits with which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:171433:26"/>
theſe frothy and boyling ſeeds abound, and are as inſtruments with which it begins to trace out the firſt lineaments of all the parts, to which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (making uſe of the menſtruous blood flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it) it gives in time growth, and the laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Generation may be divided into three different ſeaſons, which are, the beginning, middle, and the end. The beginning is, when there is no other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Womb but the two ſeeds, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo to the ſixth day, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> notes; and calls them for that time <hi>the geniture,</hi> as much as to ſay, from whence generation muſt proceed: he ſpeaks of it in his Book <hi>De Natura Pueri:</hi> and he ſaith, that by the experiences he brings of it, one may judge of the other times. He relates a ſtory of a Woman, which at ſix dayes end caſt forth with a noiſe at once out of her Womb the ſeeds ſhe had conceived, reſembling a raw egg, without a ſhell, having only the ſmall skin over it; or, to the abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive eggs, which have no ſhell: which little mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane was on the outſide a little coloured with red, and involved in it this ſeed, which was of a round figure: in the internal part might be ſeen white and reddiſh fibres, with a thick humour, in the midſt of which was found ſomething like the umbilick veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls this firſt time of generation, <hi>Geniture,</hi> as is already mentioned, during which time neither figure nor diſtinction can be obſerved, but only ſome beginning of a diſpoſition to receive the form of the parts; after which follows the ſecond time, which begins where the firſt ends, that is, at the ſixth day, and laſts to the 30th. The time that the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> aſſures us the males are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:171433:26"/>
formed, and the females not till the 42<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. After the firſt ſix dayes are paſt, and the Womb hath wrought, according to the faſhion we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, upon the ſeeds, which are there yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture of blood, having diſpoſed them to receive it; it is brought thither, in ſome ſooner, in ſome later, according to the Womans being nearer to or further from her time of having her Courſes when ſhe conceived, which produceth effects ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe different diſpoſitions: for if they flow too ſoon, or in too great abundance, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals ſuch as conceive at the point of having their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, the ſeeds are drowned and corrupted by it, which often cauſeth a flooding, or at leaſt the generation of a falſe-conception; but if they are far from their having them, the conception is ſo much the more ſtable. Now then, this blood di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling by little and little into the Womb of the Woman, who hath ſometime ſince conceived, ſerves as a fit matter to form and figure out all the parts of the Infant, which was only traced out by the ſeed; and yet doth it (according to my opinion) much like a Painter, who after he hath drawn the out-lines with a chauk upon his cloth, begins to lay colour upon colour, to paint by degrees all the parts of the perſon whoſe picture he draws. Some little ſpace after the beginning of this ſecond time, appears as it were the figure of thoſe three bubbles, of which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaks, or rather three maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this matter, which groſly repreſent the three parts called principal, the firſt of which compoſeth the Head; the ſecond, in the middle, the Heart; and the other the Liver: there may be likewiſe ſeen the after birth, with the umbilick veſſels faſtened to it,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:171433:27"/>
and the membranes which wrapt up the whole; after which from day to day all the other parts of the body are figured in ſuch ſort, that at thirty dayes end the males are compleatly formed, and the females the 42th day ordinarily, which is about the time the <hi>Faetus</hi> begins to be animated, though as yet there is no ſenſible motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeems by theſe different terms to be of an opinion that the Males have ſooner life than the Females, becauſe (he ſaith) their heat is greater: but for my part I do not beleive that the Male is ſooner formed than the Female, and that which thus perſwades me, is, becauſe, if it were ſo, the Male muſt likewiſe be at its full term, ſooner than the Female, proportionable to the ſame time, that the one is animated ſooner than the other; which wee ſee the contrary, in that the Women are brought to Bed indifferently both of Sons and Daughters at the ordinary terme of nine months. Let us therefore ſay, that towards the fifth or ſixth week, as well Males as Females have all the parts of their body (though ſmall and very tender) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely formed and figured, at which time it is not longer than a finger, and from thence afterwards, which is our third time, the blood flowing every day more and more to the Womb (not by Intervals, as the Courſes, but continually) it daily grows bigger and ſtronger to the end of the ninth month, which is the full term of ordinary labour. Having expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Conception and Generation, let us now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider great Bellies and their differences.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of big Bellies, and their differences; with the ſigns of the true and falſe great Bellies.</head>
               <p>THE great Belly of a Woman properly taken, is a tumour cauſed by the Infants ſcituation in the Womb. There are natural great Bellies, which contain a living Child, and theſe we call true; and others againſt nature, in which, inſtead of a Child, is ingendred nothing but ſtrange matter, as Wind mixed with Waters, which are called Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of the Womb, Falſe-Conceptions, Moles, or Membranes full of blood and corrupted ſeed; for which reaſon they are called falſe great Bellies. We have already, where we treated of Conception and Generation, mentioned the cauſes and ſigns of a great Belly in its beginning, notwithſtanding we will again repeat the moſt certain and ordinary of them, which are nauſeouſneſs, vomittings, loſs of appetite to things the Woman was accuſtomed to eat and like; longings for ſtrange and naughty things; ſuppreſſion of the Terms, without Feaver or Shiverings, or other cauſe; pains and ſwelling of the Breaſts: all which may be found in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, by the retention of their Courſes: but the moſt certain is, if putting the finger into the <hi>Vagina,</hi> you perceive the inward Orifice exactly cloſe, as alſo the diſtention of the body of the Womb conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, more or leſs, according to the time the Woman is gone with Child, and the Childs ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:171433:28"/>
in the Womb, gives us indubitable proofs of it. It is fit we ſhould be alwayes careful not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by what we feel ſtir in the Womb, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Infant of it ſelf hath a total and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial motion; the total is, when it removes the whole body, and the partial is when it moves but one part at a time, as the Head, Arm, or Leg, the reſt of the body lying ſtill: but the Womb blown up in fits of the Mother, yea, and ſome Moles have by accident a kind of total motion, but never a partial one. That of a Mole is rather a motion of falling down than otherwiſe, to wit, a motion by which heavy things fall downwards: for a Woman who hath a Mole of any bigneſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whatſoever ſide ſhe turns her ſelf to, her belly falls immediatly the ſame way, like a heavy bowl. About the time (or very near) when the Infant quickens, if the Woman be certainly with Child, theſe humors (which are carried to the Breaſts by the ſtoppage of her Courſes) are turned to Milk, which when it happens, is uſually an aſſured teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of pregnancy; though ſome Women have been found with Milk in their Breaſts (but rarely) and yet not with Child, nor ever having had any: which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> alſo confirms in his 39th Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm of his 5th Book, where he ſaith, <hi>Si mulier quae nec praegnans, nec puerpera eſt, lac habet, ei men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrua defecerunt.</hi> If a Woman hath milk in her Breaſts, and is neither with Child, nor ever had any, it comes from the ſtoppage of her Courſes. But it is rather whey than milk, which in that caſe hath not the conſiſtence as the Milk of a Woman in Childbed, nay the Milk of a Woman with Child is yet but wateriſh, and becomes neither thick nor
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:171433:28"/>
very white, till after labour ſhe begins to ſuckle her Child.</p>
               <p>The Infant moves it ſelfe manifeſtly about the fourth month: or ſooner or later according as it is more or leſs ſtrong: ſome Women feel it from the ſecond, others about the third month, yea ſome before that time. In the beginning theſe firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are very ſmall, and very like to thoſe of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sparrow when firſt hatched, but grow greater, proportionably as the Infant grows bigger and ſtronger, and at laſt are ſo violent, that they force the Womb to diſcharge its ſelf of its burden, as in Travail. The common opinion is, that the Males quicken before the Females, becauſe their heat is greater, but that is almoſt equal; for there are ſome Women perceive their Daughters, others their Sons ſooneſt, which happens indifferently to Males and Females, according as there was a more or leſs vigorous diſpoſition at their Generation. Very often Women who daily uſe Copulation, are ſubject to be deceived; for they uſually believe they are with Child if their Courſes ſtop, and withal are a little qualmiſh, which is not always true, for falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions cauſe almoſt the ſame accidents as true; which cannot eaſily be diſtinguiſhed but by its conſequences. This falſe great-Belly is, as we have already ſaid, often cauſed by wind, which blows up and diſtends the Womb, and which Women oft-times diſcharge with as much noiſe as if it came from the Fundament: ſometimes 'tis nothing but water which is gathered there in ſuch abundance, as ſome Women have been ſeen to void a pail full without any Child; though they verily believed they were with Child, as did that Wood-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:171433:29"/>
whoſe ſtory you have in the end of the third Chapter, who did not void it till the end of the tenth mouth, till when ſhe alwayes believed her ſelf with Child. There are others who conceive only falſ-conceptions and Moles, which may be known by the Infants different motions, already mentioned, and by the Moles continuing in the Womb often after the ordinary time of labour, ſome Women having them a whole year, yea many years, according as theſe Moles are more or leſs adhering to the inner parts of the Womb, and are there entertained and nouriſhed by the blood that flows thither.</p>
               <p>Moles alwayes proceed from ſome falſe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, which continuing in the Womb, grow there by the blood that flows to them, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of which they are by little and little augmented: if the Womb expels it before two months, it's call'd a falſ-conception, &amp; ſome are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but as it were the Seed involved in a membrane, like that geniture which that Woman voided after ſix or ſeven dayes, of whom <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaks in his Book, <hi>De natura Pueri.</hi> The others are a little more ſolid and fleſhy, reſembling in ſome ſort the Gizard of a Foul, and are greater or leſs, according to the time they ſtay in the Womb, and alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quantity of blood with which they are alwayes ſoaked. Women expel theſe falſ-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions ſooner or later, according as they cleave to the Womb, which makes them almoſt alwayes flood in great quantity at thoſe tunes.</p>
               <p>It is of great importance to diſtinguiſh well between a true and a falſe Belly; for the faults committed by a miſtake, are ever very conſiderable:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:171433:29"/>
foraſmuch as in a true great Belly the Child ought to continue in the Womb, till Nature<note n="*" place="margin">This excludes not Art to aſſiſt Nature, if not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perform its duty in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> expels it by a natural labour: but contrarily, the falſe great-Belly indicates to us, to procure the expulſion of what it contains as ſoon as may be: Wherefore we ought to be very careful.</p>

               <p>IF prudence be neceſſary to enable a Chirurgeon or Midwife to aſſure a Woman that ſhe is with Child, or not, and of a true or a falſe-conception; it is likewiſe as much requiſite for them to know how far ſhe is gone, to the end they may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether the Infant be yet quick or no, which is of great moment: becauſe, according to the Law, if a big-bellied Woman miſcarry by a wound, he that ſtruck her, deſerves Death, in caſe the Child were quick, otherwiſe he is only condemned in a pecuniary puniſhment: they ought likewiſe to take heed leſt they cauſe the death of the Infants, and ſometimes of their Mother, by haſtening<note n="*" place="margin">To be underſtood by Medicines, as appears by the word [miſcarry] follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing.</note> their labour before its time, by imagining that when the big-bellied Woman complains of great pains in her Back and Belly, they are the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:171433:30"/>
pains of her Labour, and inſtead of endeavouring to hinder them, they contrarily provoke them, and cauſe them to miſcarry unfortunately before their time, I knew a Woman called <hi>Martha Rolet,</hi> who being ſix months gone with Child or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, was ſurprized with great pains, much like throws of Labour, which made her ſend for her Midwife, who as ſoon as ſhe was come, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the caſe no better than they uſe to do, endeavoured all ſhe could to bring her to bed, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting her pains, by ſharp Clyſters, making her walk about her Chamber, as if ſhe had been at her full time; but finding at two dayes end no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, notwithſtanding the continual pains, ſhe ſent for me to know what was fit for her to do in that caſe: I went to the Woman, and found the inward orifice of the Womb dilated enough for the top of my little Finger to enter into its inward part, and yet wider towards the outward part; but conſidering that ſhe had no other accident but thoſe pains, I cauſed her immediatly to go to bed, where ſhe continued eight or nine dayes, in which time her pains ceaſed, the Womb cloſed exactly, as I found ſome dayes after, and ſhe went on with her Child three full months longer, and was then brought to bed of a Daughter at the full time, ſtrong and robuſt, which is yet living, and now five years old or thereabouts. Now had I purſued what they began, this Woman without doubt would have miſcarried at ſix months, which would have<note n="*" place="margin">Implies Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> killed the Infant in her Belly, and ſoon after ſhe ſhould have miſcarried. It is fit to follow
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:171433:30"/>
this example in the like occaſion, provided the pains are not accompanied with accidents, which may endanger the life of the Mother if not preſently delivered; as frequent Convulſions, conſiderable floodings, of which we ſhall ſpeak in its place.</p>
               <p>To be well informed of the different times of pregnancy, the Womans own relation may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſerve turn, yet 'tis not fit alwayes to truſt it; it may help to conjecture, becauſe many Women are themſelves deceived, concluding themſelves with Child, from the ſtaying of their Courſes, or from their quickning, which is not alwayes a certain rule. We uſually judge of it by the bigneſs of the Belly: but more ſurely by touching the inward ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Womb. When they are young with Child, we can only know it by the ſigns of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe what is then in the Womb is of no conſiderable bigneſs to ſwell a Belly; but rather on the contrary, at that time it grows ſlatter, for the reaſons before recited: but after the ſecond month the Belly begins by degrees to wax bigger, till the ninth month. At the beginning, in touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inward orifice, you find it exactly cloſe and ſomewhat long, reſembling the muzzle of a Puppy new pup'd; and is then very thick: but by little and little, through the extenſion of the Womb, it diminiſheth ſo in all its proportions, that when the Woman cometh near her reckoning, it is perfectly flat, and almoſt equal with the globe of the Womb, and in that manner, that it becomes like a ſmall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, a little thick at its entry, where the Garland is made at the time of Labour.</p>
               <p>Neither may the time of pregnancy be alwayes judged by the great ſwelling of the Belly; becauſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:171433:31"/>
ſome Women are bigger when they are half gone, than others are at their reckoning; it depending much on the bigneſs of the Infant, and alſo on their number; and yet again, according as there is more or leſs water incloſed with them in the Womb; but much rather by the internal Orifice, which grows daily thinner and flatter, and ſo much the more by how much the Women come nearer their reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: much in the ſame manner as we ſee a tender skin diminiſh in thickneſs, according as it is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dilated; even ſo this orifice grows thinner by the extenſion which the head of the Infant cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to it, which uſually preſſeth hard againſt it in the laſt months. This remark is often uſeful to us in the admiſſion of big-bellied Women, that deſire to lie in in the<note n="*" place="margin">An Hoſpital ſo called, in Paris.</note> 
                  <hi>Hoſtel de Dieu</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> which I very often obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my practiſe there of Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the year 1660, through the permiſſion which my Lord, the firſt Preſident, was pleaſed to give me, (for there is no place ſo fit to perfect one in a ſhort time, in the practice of ſo neceſſary an operation, becauſe of the great number which are there daily delivered of all ſorts) the order is, that any Women with Child ſhall be there charitably received fifteen dayes, or thereabouts, before their reckoning; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they are ſearcht before they are admitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many, glad of a good entertainment for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preſent themſelves there two or three months before they ſhould, ſaying and affirming they are near their time; but by the above-mentioned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, one may eaſily judge and know within a very little, who are fit to be received and who not,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:171433:31"/>
that is, when they are near their time; and by this means may likewiſe know when 'tis neceſſary to forward Labour, or retard it, as much as ought to be, when Women are not yet gone their full time.</p>
               <p>As to what reſpects the ſeveral terms, to which a Woman may go with Child; there is a great controverſie amongſt Authors, but all agree that the moſt ordinary terms are either the ſeventh or the ninth month, which is known and alſo approved by all. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is of an opinion that the Child born in the eight month cannot live, becauſe he cannot ſupport two ſuch puiſſant endeavours ſo near one to another, having already endeavoured to be born the ſeventh month, which is (as he ſaith) the firſt legitimate term of Labour; and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, if, reiterating the ſame endeavours the eighth month, he be born, he is thereby ſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that he ſeldom lives, as he often doth, when born by the firſt endeavours in the ſeventh month, his ſtrength not being before exhauſted by vain attempts. This ſeems very likely to many: but if they that practiſe Deliveries, make a true reflection on it, they will find, that it is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix alone, aſſiſted with the compreſſion of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the lower Belly and <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> which cauſe the expulſion of the Child, being ſtirred up by it's weight, and not able to be further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to contain it; and not, as is ordinarily believed, that the Infant (being no longer able to ſtay there for want of the nouriſhment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment) uſeth his pretended indeavours to come forth thence, and to that purpoſe kicking ſtrongly, he breaks with his feet the membranes which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:171433:32"/>
the waters, inaſmuch as when the Child is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally born, the membranes are alwayes rent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the head, which preſſing and thruſting each throw the waters before it, cauſeth them to burſt out with force. The ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> likewiſe admits the tenth month, as alſo the beginning of the eleventh, at which time he ſaith the Children live: but he will by no means that Children can live if born before the ſeventh, foraſmuch as they are then too feeble, and not capable to ſupport the external injuries, as indeed we ſee and find it every day.</p>
               <p>I do boldly affirm, and it is alſo very true, that the ordinary term of going with Child is nine whol months: but I cannot conſent that Children born in the ſeventh month, do oftner live than thoſe of the eighth; but much to the contrary I believe, that the nearer they approach to the natural term of nine months, the ſtronger they are; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Children born in the eighth month rather live than thoſe of the ſeventh: which is wholly contrary to the opinion of many perſons, who blindly follow in this the ſenſe of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and all Authors, without making any reflection upon the thing, for to diſabuſe themſelves of this vulgar belief, founded upon the pretended vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which (they ſay) are made by the Infant in the ſeventh month: for, as we ſee, not only in the ſame Country and Field, but alſo on the ſame Vine-Grapes, ſometimes ſix weeks ripe before their ordinary ſeaſon, and others not till above a month after, which happens according to the Territories, the different regards of the Sun, and according as the Vine is cultivated: So likewiſe we ſee Women
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:171433:32"/>
brought to bed of their Children ſix weeks and two months before, and ſometimes as long after their ordinary tearm; If it be not, that the Womb not being capable of an extention beyond a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, cannot bear its burden, but a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet the reckoning is out, although there have been Women, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> acknowledgeth, who have gone ten or eleven whole months with Child, which notwithſtanding is ſo much the more rare, by how much it exceeds its limits. Theſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen alſo to Women according to the different diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions either of their whole body, or of their Womb alone, or as well according to their rule of living, and the greater or leſſer exerciſe they uſe, and may likewiſe happen on the Childs part: for by example, if at ſeven months he is ſo big, that the Womb can no longer contain him, nor dilate it ſelf more without burſting, it is then provoked by the pain which this violent extention cauſeth, to diſcharge it ſelf of him; and ſo likewiſe in the eighth month, if there be the ſame reaſon, and ſome weeks ſooner or later, according to a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of other circumſtances; or alſo by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſe, as a violent ſhaking of the whole body, blow, fall, leap, or any other cauſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, haſtening the pains of Delivery; that which makes theſe Children live a longer, or a leſſer while, is, according as they are at that time more ſtrong and perfect, and the Woman nearer her time, which is at the end of the ninth month.</p>
               <p>There are many Women that believed they were brought to bed at the 7th and 8th month; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe others, that they went 10 or 11 whole months
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:171433:33"/>
with Child (which may ſome times be) when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they are effectively delivered at the due time. That which deceives them, uſually is, their believing (as we have already ſaid) them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Child from the time of the retention of their courſes, having had them during the two firſt months of their pregnancy, yea and ſometimes lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and others alſo miſreckon themſelves, when their courſes are ſtopped two months before they conceive. It is alſo eaſie to know that a Woman, though well regulated, cannot exactly know by the ſuppreſſion ſingly, the certain time of her being with Child: for example, if ſhe lies with her Husband upon the point of the coming down of her terms, and ſhe conceives upon it, then ſhe may make her reckoning from the time of their ſuppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may be very near the truth: but if ſhe conceives immediatly after ſhe hath had them (which happens ofteneſt) and that all along the whole month ſhe daily copulates with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, at the end of which time her courſes not coming down, ſhe may very well reckon her ſelf with Child; yet for all this ſhe cannot know by this ſign which night ſhe conceived; and ſo for three weeks or a month more or leſs ſhe may be miſtaken in the time.</p>
               <p>As we have ſaid, that Children are more or leſs long-lived, according as they approach nearer the ninth month; ſo we may eaſily know, that they of ſix months, and much leſs thoſe that are younger, cannot be long-lived, becauſe they are yet too weak to reſiſt the outward injuries. There hath often been great conteſtations amongſt the Phyſitians, to determine, whether a Child born the eleventh or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:171433:33"/>
twelfth month after its pretended Fathers death, can be legitimately born, and conſequently admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Inheritance, or rather diſinherited as a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Child.</p>
               <p>This queſtion hath been well debated ſometimes by the <hi>Romans</hi> as well as by us, and there have been parties both for and againſt this opinion; as for my part I will, to avoid prolixity, leave it unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, and add nothing upon this point to what I have mentioned before.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Whether it may be known that a Woman is with Child of a Boy, or a Girl, and the ſigns whether ſhe ſhall have many Children.</head>
               <p>IT is no great matter to ſatisfie the curioſity and diſquiet of a Woman, who deſires often to know whether ſhe be with Child or no; but there are many, and almoſt all, that would have one proceed further, and tell them whether it be a Boy or a Girl, which is abſolutely impoſſible; though there is hardly a Midwife which will not boaſt her ſelf able to reſolve it (in effect it is eaſier to gueſs, than to find the truth) for when it happens, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly rather by chance, than by any knowledge or reaſon they could have to enable them to foretell it. But ſometimes one is ſo preſſed and importuned to give judgment, chiefly by Women who never had Children, and often by their Husbands, who are not leſs curious, that one is obliged to ſatisfie
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:171433:34"/>
them as much as poſſible in that caſe, by the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ſome ſigns very incertain.</p>
               <p>There are many ſigns upon which this knowledge is grounded (if there can be any, which I do not believe) of which the two principal are taken out of <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> the firſt is in his 42th Aphoriſm of the fifth book, which is, <hi>Mulier gravida, ſi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem gerit, bene colorate eſt; ſi vero faeminam, male calorata:</hi> A Woman with Child of a Boy is well coloured; but of a Girl, ill coloured. And the other is in his 48th Aphoriſm of the ſame book, which is, <hi>Faetus mares dextra uteri parte, faeminae finiſtra magis geſtantur:</hi> For the moſt part the Male Children lye in the right ſide, and the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males in the left. Moreover, they ſay, a Woman with Child of a Boy, is more merry and jockond, goes with it much better, is not ſo diſguſted, finds it quicken ſooner, and her right Breaſts fill before the left, and is alſo more firm, and that all the right parts of her body are ſtronger and more active; as for example, if ſhe ſate, kneeled, or ſtood upright, ſhe would make her ſelf firſt ſtep with her right foot; but if it be a Girl, ſhe would have all the ſigns contrary to theſe above mentioned.</p>
               <p>There are ſome perſons pretend to know it by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting of Urines, which is as uncertain; for we daily find Women well coloured, and they have all the ſigns of being with Child of a Boy, and yet are brought to bed of Girles, contrary to the hopes given them: And others, though they have ſigns directly oppoſit, bring forth Boys. Some believe they underſtand it better than any other, by conſidering the time of conception; for ſay they, if the Woman conceives at the increaſe of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171433:34"/>
Moon, ſhe ſhall have a Boy, and contrarily a Girl, if at the decreaſe: but this falls out as ſeldom, as may eaſily be known, by the obſervation I have made of it at the <hi>Hoſtel de Dieu</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and may be daily obſerved by others as wel as my ſelf; which is, that having in one and the ſame day delivered 11 Women there, all at their full time, five of them had Boys, and the other ſix Girls. Now we may well judge that they all conceived at one time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all were brought to bed at the ſame time; and ought (if this rule were true, and that they were all governed by this Planet) to have had either all Boys, or all Girls; and not ſome Boys, and ſome Girls, as here it happened, and doth every day in the ſame place; whereas in all other places are indifferently born both Boys and Girls.</p>
               <p>Others again believe the Males to be begotten of the Seed which comes rather from the right Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle than the left, eſteeming it hotter and not ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh, becauſe the right Spermatick vein comes from the trunck of the <hi>Vena cava;</hi> and that of the left ſide takes its riſe from the <hi>Emulgent;</hi> but if they know after what manner the blood is circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they would find that the blood of the <hi>emulgent</hi> is not more ſerous, than that of the <hi>vena-cava,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it is purged of its ſuperfluous ſeroſity by the Reines, before it enters this <hi>emulgent;</hi> they would likewiſe know that the Seed of both Teſticles is the ſame exactly, being made of the ſame blood, brought to them not by the Reins, but only by the two Arteries, which ariſe out of the trunck <hi>Aorta,</hi> otherwiſe called the great <hi>Artery;</hi> wherefore the left is as well diſpoſed to produce Males as Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males; and therefore thoſe Husbandmen abuſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:171433:35"/>
themſelvs, in knitting up one of the teſticles of their Bulls according as they deſire either Males or Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males. I knew an <hi>Italian</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> who had but only his left Teſticle, having loſt the right upon a good occaſion, who after that accident married, and begat two Children, which I ſaw alive, and very well, one of which was a Boy and the other a Girle; beſides all thoſe he may have begotten ſince that time: nor needed he to ſuſpect his Wife had the aſſiſtance of any other in that buſineſs, as it very often happens in this Country.</p>
               <p>Such perſons as deſire to foretell before the Child be born, whether it will be Boy or Girl, do uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally adhere by complacency, to the deſires of the big-bellied Woman and her Husband in this caſe; for if the Midwife knows they deſire a Boy, ſhe will aſſure them it will be a Boy, and ſwear to it alſo; And if they wiſh for a Girl (as it alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to ſome Women, who love Girls beſt) they will ſay it ſhall be a Girl, and lay wagers of it too. If this happens luckily according to her pronoſtick, ſhe will not be backwards to affirm ſhe knew it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well: but when it happens contrary to her prediction, ſhe makes her ſelf reputed ignorant and preſumptuous, and remains aſhamed.</p>
               <p>For my part I ſhould do quite otherwiſe: for knowing beforehand the deſires of the perſons, I ſhould give my advice alwayes quite contrary to them; becauſe if it happen to be true (although by chance) what was foretold, they will then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude me to be knowing, and to have ſaid well: and if otherwiſe (which may be once in twice) the Woman and her Husband obtaining what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, will not take ſo much notice of it, becauſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:171433:35"/>
one alwayes receives with a good welcom what they deſire, though unhoped for.</p>
               <p>Having ſhewed that it is impoſſible to know whether a big-bellied Woman ſhall have a Boy or Girl, becauſe of the uncertainty of the ſigns, upon which they ground their predictions; We will aſſert that it is not the ſame in the knowledge one may have, whether a Woman is conceived of more than one. There are many Authors who have affirmed that a Woman cannot bring forth above two Children at once, becauſe they have but two Breaſts; as alſo, becauſe that there are but two cavities in the Womb, different from moſt other Animals, which hath many little cells in it, and alſo many teats, wherefore they bring forth many young ones, who uſually anſwer the number of the little cells of their Womb: this is very true in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of other Animals, but the Womb of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath but one only cavity (unleſs they would have the two ſides taken for cavities) for there is in the Womb only a ſimple long line, without any other ſeparation.</p>
               <p>We ſee daily Women brought to bed of two Children at once, ſometimes of three, and very rarely of four. Yet I knew one Mr. <hi>Hebert,</hi> Couverer of the King's Buildings, who was ſo good a Couverer, that his Wife about ſeventeen years ſince brought forth four living Children at a birth; which the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> deceaſed coming to hear of, to whom (becauſe of his jovial humour) he was very welcom; the Duke asked him (in the preſence of divers Perſons of Quality) whether it were true, that he was ſo good a Fellow as to get his Wife with Child of thoſe four at one bout? He anſwered ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:171433:36"/>
coldly, <hi>Yes; and that he had certainly begat at the ſame time half a dozen, if his foot had not ſlipt;</hi> which made them all laugh very heartily.</p>
               <p>But I eſteem it either a Miracle, or a Fable, what is related in the Hiſtory of the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Holland,</hi> who in the year 1313 was brought to bed of 365 Children at one and the ſame time; which happened to her (as they ſay) by a poor Womans Imprecation, who asking an Alms of her, related to her the great miſery ſhe was in by reaſon of thoſe Children ſhe had with her: To which the Lady anſwered, <hi>She might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the inconvenience, ſince ſhe had had the pleaſure of getting them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſince the moſt uſual number is two, that Women have at once, (who have more than one Child at a time) We will give the ſigns of it, which do not appear in the firſt months, nor ſometimes till they are quick. There is ſome likelihood of it, if the Woman be extraordinary big, and yet ſuſpects no Dropſie; and more, if there be on each ſide of the Belly a little riſing, and as it were a line a little depreſſed, or not ſo elevated about the middle; and moſt of all, if at the ſame time one feels many and different motions on both ſides; and if theſe motions are more frequent than uſually, which is, becauſe the Infants being ſtraitned, inconvenience one the other, and cauſe each other to move in that faſhion: If all theſe ſigns concur, 'tis then very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the Woman goes with more than one Child.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of SuPERFAETATION.</head>
               <p>THere is a great diſpute, whether a Woman (who hath two or more Children at once) conceived of them at one, or at ſeveral Coitions. We ſee indeed daily that Bitches, Sows, and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits have divers young with but once copulating, which may very well make us judge the ſame of a Woman. Some will have this to be by <hi>Superfae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> but there are ſigns by which we may know the difference, whether both Children were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten at once; or ſucceſſively one after the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Superfaetation,</hi> according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his Book which treats of it, is a reiterated conception, when a Woman being already with Child, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives again the ſecond time. That which makes many beleive there can be no <hi>Superfaetation,</hi> is; becauſe, as ſoon as a Woman hath conceived, her Womb cloſeth and is exactly firm, ſo that the Seed of the Man, abſolutely neceſſary to conception, finding no place nor entry, cannot (as they ſay) be received, nor contained in it, ſo to cauſe this ſecond conception. To this may be added, that a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Woman diſchargeth her Seed (which is as neceſſary for it as a Mans) by a veſſel which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates on the ſide of the exteriour part of the inward orifice; which Seed by this means is ſhed into the <hi>Vagina,</hi> and not into the bottom of the Womb, as it ſhould for this purpoſe. However, it may be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:171433:37"/>
ſaid in anſwer to theſe objections, which are very ſtrong, that (though the Womb be uſually exactly ſhut and cloſe when a Woman hath conceived, and beſides, that ſhe then ſheds her Seed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conveyance) yet this general rule may have ſome exceptions, and that the Womb, ſo cloſed, is ſometimes opened to let paſs ſome ſerous ſlimy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, which by their ſtay offend it; or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, when a Woman is animated with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire of copulation, in the heat of which acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe ſometimes diſchargeth by the paſſage that terminates in the bottom of the Womb, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dilated and opened by the impetuous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Seed, agitated and over-heated more than ordinary, and this orifice being at the ſame time a little opened, if the Mans Seed be darted into it at the ſame moment, it is thought a Woman may then again conceive, which is called <hi>Superfae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> This is confirmed by a Hiſtory of a Servant, related by <hi>Pliny,</hi> who having the ſame day copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with two ſeveral perſons, brought forth two Children, the one reſembling her Maſter, the other his Proctor. And alſo of another Woman, who likewiſe had two Children, the one like her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and the other like her Gallant: but this different reſemblance doth not altogether prove <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfaetation,</hi> becauſe ſometimes different imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may cauſe the ſame effect.</p>
               <p>This ſecond conception is effectively as rare, as we find the deciſion of it uncertain; nor muſt we imagine that alwayes, when a Woman brings forth two Children or more at once, there is a <hi>Superfae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> becauſe they are almoſt alwayes begot in the ſame act, by the abundance of both Seeds recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:171433:37"/>
into the Womb: nor believe neither, that it may be at all times of a Womans being with Child: for when it happens, it cannot be either the firſt or ſecond day of conception; becauſe, if the laſt Seed be received into the Womb, it would make a mixture and confuſion with the firſt, which is not yet involved with this little pellicle, that might otherwiſe ſeparate it; nor is it formed perfectly till the ſixth or ſeventh day, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaw in a Woman, who about that time expelled this geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Beſides, the Matrix again opening it ſelf, could not hinder the firſt Seed from ſlipping out, being not as yet wrapt up in this little membrane, which could preſerve it. This makes me not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Hiſtory of the Woman, whom <hi>Pliny</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that it happened for the reaſons alledged by him, to wit, that ſhe uſed copulation the ſame day with two ſeveral perſons: for the laſt would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have cauſed this confuſion of Seed, as I have ſaid, and ſo deſtroyed the work begun; but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe, that this <hi>Superfaetation</hi> may happen from the ſixth day of conception, or thereabouts, till the thirtieth or fourtieth at the moſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the Seeds are covered with membranes, and that which is contained in the Womb is not yet of a conſiderable bigneſs: but after this time, it is impoſſible, or at leaſt very difficult, becauſe the Womb being extended more and more by the growth of the Child, can hardly receive new Seed, and as hardly retain it, or hinder it from being caſt forth by reaſon of its fulneſs, having received it in that eſtate.</p>
               <p>When a Woman brings forth one or more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at a birth, begotten at once, which uſually
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:171433:38"/>
are called Twins, (and differs from <hi>Superfaetation</hi>) 'tis known by their being both almoſt of an equal thickneſs and bigneſs, and having but one only and common after-birth, not ſeparated the one from the other, but by their membranes, which wrap each apart with their waters, and not both in the ſame membrane and waters, as ſome have believed, contrary to the truth: but if there are ſeveral Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and a Superfaetation, they will be alſo ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by their membranes, but not have a common burthen, but each his apart; neither will they be of an equal bigneſs, for that which is the <hi>Superfae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> will alwayes be leſſer and weaker, than that which was engendred at firſt; who, becauſe of its force and vigor, draws to it ſelf the greateſt and beſt part of the nouriſhment: Juſt as we find in fair and great Fruit, that have often near them very little ones; which happens, becauſe thoſe that are firſt knotted and faſtned to the Tree, take away all the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from their neighbours, who did but bloſſom when the firſt had already acquired ſome bigneſs. Sometimes Twins are not of an equal bigneſs, which happens according as the one or the other hath more ſtrength to draw to it in greater abundance the beſt part of the common nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>Six years ſince I layed a Woman at her full time, whom I delivered of a very great living Girl by the feet, which firſt came to the birth; and fetching the after-birth, I brought with it another Child, a dead Boy, as little again as the firſt Girl; and which ſeemed not to be, reſpecting his bigneſs, above five or ſix months; although they were both begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at one and the ſame act of Copulation, as was manifeſt by their both having but one and the ſame
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:171433:38"/>
burthen, which is the true ſign of it, as I have already ſaid; and this ſecond Child was ſo little, that it came together with the burthen, and wrapt up in the membranes; which I preſently opened, to ſee whether it were alive; but it had been a long time dead, as appeared by its corruption.</p>
               <p>I am not willing to ſay that there never is any <hi>Superfaetation,</hi> but I ſay, that it happens very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for of an hundred Women that have Twins, ninety of them have but one burthen common to both; which is a very certain ſign they had no <hi>Superfaetation,</hi> and much more certain than the Indications taken from the greatneſs or ſtrength of the Child, which is but conjectural.</p>

               <p>OF all the ſeveral ſorts of Great-Bellies in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, there remains that yet to be examined which is cauſed by a <hi>Mole,</hi> of which we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes endeavour the expulſion aſſoon as we come to know it, being altogether contrary to nature. The <hi>Mole</hi> is nothing elſe but a fleſhy ſubſtance, without bones, joynts, or diſtinction of members; without form or figure, regulated and determined; engendred againſt Nature in the Womb, after Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, out of the corrupted Seed of both the Man and Woman. Notwithſtanding, there are ſometimes ſome that have ſome rudiments of a rough form.</p>
               <p>It is very certain, Women never engender <hi>Moles</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:171433:39"/>
without the uſe of copulation, both Seeds being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to it, as well as for a true generation. There are ſome, truly, who never having had to do with a Man, do naturally caſt forth, after a flouding, ſome ſtrange bodies, which in appearance ſeem to be fleſh; but if one take ſpecial notice thereof, they will find it but clods of blood coagulated, without conſiſtence or fleſhy texture, or membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, as are the Moles and falſe-Conceptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moles</hi> are ordinarily engendred, when either the Man or the Womans Seed, or both together, are weak, or corrupted, the Womb not labouring for a true conception, but by the help of the Spirits with which the Seed ought to be repleniſhed: but ſo much the eaſier, as the ſmall quantity found in it is extinguiſhed, and as it were choaked, or drowned by abundance of the groſs and corrupted men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous blood, which ſometimes flows thither ſoon after conception, and gives not leiſure to Nature to perfect, what ſhe hath with great pains begun, and ſo troubling its work, bringing thither confuſion and diſorder, there is made of the ſeeds and blood a meer <hi>Chaos,</hi> call'd a <hi>Mole,</hi> not uſually engendred but in the Womb of a Woman, and never or very rarely found in that of other Animals, becauſe they have no menſtruous blood, as ſhe hath.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Mole</hi> hath no burthen, nor navel-ſtring faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it, as a Child alwayes hath; foraſmuch as the Mole it ſelf adheres to the Womb, by which means it receives nouriſhment from its veſſels: it is likewiſe cloathed uſually with a kind of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, in which is found a piece of fleſh confuſedly interlaced with many veſſels; it is of a bigneſs and conſiſtence more or leſs according to the abundance
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:171433:39"/>
of blood it receives, according to its diſpoſition, and alſo according to the temperature of the Womb, and the time it ſtayes there; for the longer it ſtayes, the harder it grows, and becomes ſchirrous, and difficult to be expell'd. For the moſt part there is but one, yet ſometimes more; of which, ſome cleave very ſtrongly, others very ſlightly to the Womb. When Women miſcarry of them before the ſecond month, they are called falſe-Conceptions: when they keep them longer, and that this ſtrange body begins to grow bigger, they are called <hi>Moles.</hi> Falſe-Conceptions are more membranous, and ſometimes full of corrupted Seed; but <hi>Moles</hi> are altogether fleſhy. One may find in a Woman that hath a <hi>Mole,</hi> almoſt all the ſigns of Conception, and of a Woman with Child; but there are likewiſe ſome other which differ, becauſe her belly is harder and ſorer, than when ſhe is with Child. The <hi>Mole</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to Nature, is very troubleſome to a Woman: and as it hath no true life, nor animal motion; ſo it is very painful to go with: for the Mole falls on whatſoever ſide ſhe turns, when ſhe is a little big, juſt like a heavy Bowl: She hath a great wearineſs in her legs and thighs, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of urine from time to time, and finds a great heavineſs in the bottom of her belly, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this maſs of fleſh by its weight weighs down the Womb, which compreſſeth the bladder of urine: her breaſts are not ſo ſwell'd, neither have they any, or very little milk. It may be yet eaſier known, if with all theſe ſigns ſhe finds no motion after the 4th or 5th month of her Great-Belly; and certainly, if after her reckoning is out, all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſigns remain and continue in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:171433:40"/>Theſe <hi>Moles</hi> are nouriſhed in the womb, to which they almoſt alwayes adhere, and are ſuſtained by the blood with which it is alwayes furniſhed, juſt as Plants are by the moiſture of the Earth. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is a Child together with a <hi>Mole,</hi> from which it is ſometimes divided, and ſometimes cleaving to its body; which puts it in great danger of being miſhapen or monſtrous, becauſe of the compreſſion which this ſtrange body cauſeth to the Infant yet very tender. In the year 1665, being at Mr. <hi>Bourdelots,</hi> Doctor in Phyſick of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Paris,</hi> where was every Monday held Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Conferences: As they fell upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>Circulation of the Blood,</hi> which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained according to my opinion, they brought thither the Infant of a Woman newly brought to bed at her full time, which wanted all the upper part of the head, having no skull, no brain, no nor any hairy ſcalp; but had only, in lieu of all thoſe parts, a Mole, or fleſhy maſs flat and red, of the thickneſs and bigneſs of an after-burthen, covered with a ſimple membrane ſtrong enough: This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant had however all the other parts of the body fat, and well compoſed and ſhap'd. This monſtrous diſpoſition was the cauſe of its death aſſoon as it was born, and yet it was very wonderful and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing to conſider, how it could live ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out brain; as alſo very difficult to underſtand, how this fleſhy maſs could ſerve in ſtead of it, whilſt it was in the Mothers belly. It was interwoven with many veſſels, like a kind of<note n="*" place="margin">The fleſhy part of the burthen.</note> 
                  <hi>Placenta,</hi> yet of a more firm ſubſtance. Mr. <hi>Clerk</hi> and Mr. <hi>Juillet,</hi> my Brethren and good Friends,

were then preſent, and ſaw this Prodigy as well as my ſelf.</p>
               <p>A Woman having a Mole, hath a much worſe colour, and is every way more inconvenienced, than a Woman with Child; and if ſhe keeps it long, ſhe lives all the while in danger of her life. Some have them two or three years, and ſometimes all the reſt of their lives: As hapned to a Peuterer's Wife, of whom <hi>Ambroſe Paré</hi> makes mention in his Book of Generation, who had one ſeventeen years, and at laſt died of it. We will declare the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies convenient for it in another place, where we ſpeak of its extraction.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> In what manner a Woman ought to govern her ſelf during her being with Child, when it is not accompanied with other conſiderable accidents, to endeavour to prevent them.</head>
               <p>A Woman with Child in reſpect of her preſent diſpoſition, although in good health, yet ought to be reputed even as though ſhe were ſick, during that neuter eſtate (for to be with Child, is alſo vulgarly called a ſickneſs of nine months) becauſe ſhe is then in daily expectation of many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which pregnancy uſually cauſes to thoſe that do not govern themſelves well.</p>
               <p>She ſhould in this caſe reſemble a good Pilot, who being imbarqued on a rough Sea, and full of Rocks, ſhuns the danger, if he ſteers with prudence; if
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:171433:41"/>
not, 'tis by chance, if he eſcapes Shipwrack: So a Woman with Child is often in danger of her life, if ſhe doth not her beſt endeavour to ſhun and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent many accidents to which ſhe is then ſubject; all which time there muſt be care taken of two, to wit, her ſelf, and the Child ſhe goes with: for from one ſingle fault reſults double miſchief, inaſmuch as the Mother cannot be any wayes inconvenienced, but the Child partakes with her.</p>
               <p>Now to the end ſhe may maintain her ſelf in good health, as much as can be in that condition, which alwayes keeps a middle ſtate, let her obſerve a good dyet, ſuitable to her temperament, cuſtom, condition and quality, which the right uſe of all the ſix non-natural doth effect.</p>
               <p>The Air, where ſhe ordinarily dwells, ought to be well temper'd in all its qualities: if it be not ſo naturally, it muſt be corrected as much as may be by different means; ſhe muſt avoid that which is too hot, becauſe it often cauſeth, by diſſipating too much the humours and ſpirits, many weakneſſes to Women with Child, &amp; particularly alſo that which is too cold and foggy; for, cauſing great Rhumes and diſtillations upon the lungs, it exciteth a cough, which by its ſudden and impetuous motions, forcing downwards, may make the Woman miſcarry. She ought not to dwell in narrow Lanes very dirty, nor near common Dunghils. For ſome Women are ſo nice, that the ſtink of a Candle not well extinguiſht, is enough to bring them before their time, as <hi>Lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baut</hi> aſſures us he himſelf had ſeen: which likewiſe may be cauſed, if not ſooner, by the ſmell of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal, as hapned once to a Laundreſs, whom I knew, hat miſcarried the fourth mouth; being in extream
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:171433:41"/>
haſte to finiſh ſome Linen on a Saturday night, ſhe had not patience to kindle the Charcoal in the Chimney, but in the Room in a Chafingdiſh, which flew up into her head, and made her miſcarry the ſame night, and in danger of dying. Let the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man therefore endeavour, as much as her conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will permit, to live in an Air free from theſe inconveniencies.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of Women with Child have ſo great loathings, and ſo many different longings, and ſtrong paſſions for ſtrange things, that it is very difficult to preſcribe an exact dyet for them: but I ſhall adviſe them in this caſe to follow the opinion of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his 38th Aphoriſm, 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Book, where he ſaith, <hi>Paulo deterior &amp; potus &amp; ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, ſuavior tamen, melioribus quidem, ſed inſuavio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, praeferendus.</hi> Meat and Drink though not ſo wholſome, if it be but pleaſant, is to be preferred before that which is wholſom, if not ſo pleaſant: which in my opinion is the rule they ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, provided what they long for, is commonly uſed for dyet, and not ſtrange and extraordinary things; and that they have a care of exceſs. If the Woman be not troubled with theſe loathings, let her then uſe ſuch a dyet, which breeds good juyce, and in quantity ſufficient for her and her Child: her appetite may regulate that. She muſt not then faſt nor be abſtemious, becauſe overheating the Mothers blood thereby, renders it unfit to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the Child, which ought to be ſweet and mild, and makes it tender and weak, or conſtraius it to come before its time, to ſearch what is fit for it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: ſhe muſt not eat too much at a time, and chiefly at nights, becauſe the Womb by its extent
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:171433:42"/>
poſſeſſing a great part of the belly, hinders the ſtomach from containing much, which cauſeth thereby a difficulty of breathing, becauſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> which as then hath not an intire liberty to be moved. Wherefore let her rather eat a little and often; let her bread be pure Wheat, well baked and white, as is that of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> or the like; and not courſe houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Bread or Bisket, which ſwells up the ſtomach, nor any other of the like nature that's very ſtuffing. Let her eat good nouriſhing meat, as are the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt parts of Beef and Mutton, Veal, Fowl; as fat Pullets, Capons, Pidgeons and Partridge, either roaſt or boyled as ſhe likes beſt; freſh Egs are alſo good: And becauſe big-bellied Women have never good blood, let her put into her Broths thoſe herbs which purifie it, as Sorrel, Lettice, Succory, and Borrage; ſhe muſt avoid hot-ſeaſoned Pyes and baked Meats, and eſpecially Cruſt, becauſe being hard of digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it extreamly overchargeth the ſtomach: If ſhe hath a mind to Fiſh, let it be new, and not ſalted; Fiſh of Rivers and running ſtreams, foraſmuch as Pond-Fiſh taſts of mud, and breeds ill juyce. But if big-bellied Women cannot abſolutely refrain their extravagant longings, it is better (as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid) to ſuffer them to deviate a little from this rule or dyet (provided it be moderate) than too much to oppoſe their appetites. They may drink at their meals a little good old Wine well temper'd with Water, and rather Claret than White-wine; which will help make a good digeſtion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the ſtomach, which is alwayes weak during prenancy; and if they were not uſed to drink it before, let them accuſtom themſelves to it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:171433:42"/>
and as well in drinking as eating, they muſt ſhun all things hot and diurectick, becauſe they provoke the courſes, which is very prejudicial to the Child.</p>
               <p>By moderate ſleep, all the natural functions of a Woman are fortified, and particularly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of food in the ſtomach, which then is very ſubject to loathings and vomitings. We ſay, it muſt be moderate; becauſe, as exceſſive watchings diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the Spirits, ſo too much ſleep choak them. Let therefore Women with Child ſleep nine or ten hours at leaſt in four and twenty, and twelve at moſt; and let it be rather in the night-time, as moſt fit for reſt, than in the day, as perſons of quality are accuſtomed, who frequenting the Court, ordinarily turn night into day. However they who have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this ill habit, had better continue it than change too ſuddenly, becauſe this cuſtom is become natural to them.</p>
               <p>For what reſpects exerciſe and reſt, let them govern themſelves according to the different time of their being with Child; for at the beginning of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception (if the Woman perceives it) ſhe ought (if ſhe can) to keep her bed, at leaſt till the fifth or ſixth day, and by no means to uſe copulation all the time; foraſmuch as the Seeds being not yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the membrane, which is formed in that time (as we have ſaid already) are in the beginning, by the agitation of the body, very apt in ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſlip forth. She ought neither to go in Coach, Chariot or Waggon, nor on Horſeback, whilſt with Child; and much leſs the nearer ſhe comes to her time: becauſe this kind of exerciſe doubles the weight of what is contained in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:171433:43"/>
Womb, by the jolts ſhe receives, and often makes her miſcarry: But ſhe may walk gently, go in a Sedan or Litter; She ought neither to carry or lift heavy burdens, nor lift up her arms too high: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ought not to dreſs her own head, as ſhe uſed to do, becauſe it cannot be done without ſtretching her arms too much above her head, which hath cauſed many to miſcarry before their time; becauſe the ligaments of the Womb are at once looſned by theſe violent extenſions. Let her exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe be gentle walking, and the heels of her ſhoes low; becauſe Women cannot, for the bigneſs of their bellies, ſee their feet, and ſo are ſubject to ſtumble and fall: In ſhort, ſhe muſt govern her ſelf in theſe exerciſes, rather to err in too much reſt, than in too much exerciſe; for the danger is greater by immoderate motion, than in too much reſt. It is impoſſible for me in this point to be of the opinion of all Authors, although all the World follows them in this their evil and dangerous counſel, who would have a pregnant Woman exerciſe her ſelf more than ordinary toward the latter end of her rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, that ſo, <hi>as they ſay,</hi> the Child may ſink lower: But if they conſider the point well, they would without doubt find it to be the cauſe of more than half of the hard Labours; and that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, reſt would be more advantagious to them, as I ſhall prove by the following explication.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We muſt know and take for granted that the birth of a Child ought to be left to the work of Nature well regulated, and not to provoke it, by ſhaking it with this exerciſe, for to diſlodge it before its full time: which hapning (though it be but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight dayes ſooner) proves ſometimes as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:171433:43"/>
to the Infant, as we ſee it is ſometimes to Grapes, which we find four or five dayes before they are full ripe, to be yet almoſt half Verjuice. But to explain more clearly than by this compariſon, that theſe kind of exerciſes often cauſe hard labours, (as we have already ſaid) conſider that the Infant is naturally ſcituated in the Womb with the head uppermoſt, and the feet downwards, with its face towards the Mothers belly, juſt till it hath attained to the eighth month; at which time, and ſometimes ſooner, and ſometimes alſo later, his head being very great and heavy, he turns over, his head downward and his heels upwards, which is the ſole and true ſcituation, in which he ought to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, all other poſtures being contrary to Nature. Now juſt when the Child is about to turn according to cuſtom into his intended poſture, Inſtead of giving her ſelf reſt, ſhe falls a jumping, walking, running up and down ſtairs, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing her ſelf more than ordinary, which very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cauſes it to turn croſs, and not right as it ought to be; and ſometimes the Womb is depreſſed ſo low, and engaged in ſuch ſort towards the laſt month, in the cavity of the <hi>Hypagaſtres,</hi> by theſe joltings, that there is no liberty left the Infant to turn it ſelf naturally; wherefore it is conſtrained to come in its firſt poſture, to wit, by the feet, or ſome other worſe. Moreover, it would be very convenient that the Woman to this end ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Coition, during the two laſt months of her reckoning, foraſmuch as the body is thereby much moved, and the belly compreſſed in the action, which likewiſe cauſeth the Child to take a wrong poſture. I believe that they that will ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:171433:44"/>
reflect on theſe things, will make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to quit this old error, which hath certainly cauſed the death of many Women and Children, and much pain to divers others, for the reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned.</p>
               <p>Some Women have miſcarried only with the noiſe of a Cannon; as alſo with the ſound of a great Bell; but eſpecially with a clap of Thunder, when of a ſudden it ſurpriſeth them, and frights them.</p>
               <p>Big-bellied Women are ſometimes ſubject to be coſtive, becauſe the Womb by its weight preſſing the <hi>Rectum;</hi> hinders the Belly from diſcharging its excrements with eaſe. They that are troubled with this inconvenience may uſe Damask-Prunes ſtewed, Veal-Broth, and Herb-Pottage, with which they may gently moiſten and looſen the Belly. If theſe things are not ſufficient, they may give her gentle Clyſters of Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Pellitory and Aniſe-ſeeds, with two ounces of brown Sugar diſſolved in it, adding a little Oyl of Violets, or elſe a Decoction made with a handful of Bran, two ounces of Honey of Violets, and a piece of freſh Butter; or any other as occaſion might require: but there muſt be great care taken that no ſharp Clyſters be given her to this purpoſe, nor other Drugs to cauſe a looſneſs, or too great an evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſt it endanger her to miſcarry: as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> very well warns us in the 34th Aphoriſm of his fifth Book, where he ſayes, <hi>Mulieri in utero gerenti ſi alvus plurimum profluat, periculum eſt ne abortiat.</hi> If a big-bellied Woman have a violent looſneſs, ſhe will be in danger of miſcarrying.</p>
               <p>If ſhe ought to govern her ſelf well in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of what we have lately mentioned, ſhe ought
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:171433:44"/>
no leſs to be careful to overcome and moderate her paſſions, as not to be exceſſive angry; and above all, that ſhe be not afrighted; nor that any melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly news be ſuddenly told her: for theſe paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when violent, are capable to make a Woman miſcarry at the moment, even at any time of her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Child; as it hapned to my Couſins Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, named Mris <hi>Dionis,</hi> a Merchant, dwelling in the Street <hi>Quinquampois,</hi> whoſe Father being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly killed with a Sword by one of his Servants, who meeting him in the Street traiterouſly run him through out of ſpite and rage, becauſe he had ſome few dayes before turned him out of doors: they brought immediatly this ill news to his Wife, then eight months gone, and preſently after brought her dead Husband; at which ſudden fright ſhe was immediatly ſurpriſed with a great trembling, ſo that ſhe was preſently delivered of the ſaid <hi>Dionis,</hi> who is to this day (which is very remarkable) troubled with a ſhaking in both hands, as his Mother had when ſhe was delivered of him, having yet no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconvenience, notwithſtanding he was born in the eighth month by ſuch an extraordinary acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; nor doth he ſeem to be above fourty years old, though near fifty. When he ſigned his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Marriage, they who knew not the reaſon of it, when they ſaw his hands ſhake, thought it was through fear of his ill Bargain, of which they were diſabuſed when they had heard the <hi>Cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe</hi> that haſtened his birth. Wherefore if there be any news to tell a big-bellied Woman, let it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſuch as may moderately rejoyce her, (for exceſſive joy may likewiſe prejudice her in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) and if there be an abſolute neceſſity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiant <pb n="66" facs="tcp:171433:45"/>
her with bad news, let the gentleſt means be contrived to do it by degrees, and not all at once.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as a Woman finds her ſelf with Child, or miſtruſts it, let her not lace her ſelf ſo cloſe, as ſhe ordinarily doth, with Bodies ſtifned with Whalebone, to make her Body ſhapely, which very often injures her Breaſt, and ſo incloſing her Belly in ſo ſtrait a mould, ſhe hinders the Infant from taking its free growth, and very often makes it come before its time, and misſhapen. Thoſe Women are ſo fooliſh as not to mind, that making themſelves ſlender when they are with Child, quite ſpoils their Belly, which therefore after Childbed remains wrinkled, and pendent as a Bag, and then they cry, It is the Midwife or Nurſe that did them that miſchief, in not ſwathing and looking to them as they ought to do; not conſidering that it came by their ſtrait lacing whilſt they were big upwards, which cauſeth the Belly, finding no place to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually extended on all ſides, to dilate it ſelf onely downwards, whither all the burthen is in that manner thruſt and carried: to avoid which, let them uſe habits more large and eaſie; and wear no Busks, with which they preſſe their Bellies to bring them into ſhape. Let them alſo forbear Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in any manner, after they know they have conceived, leſt the Womb be excited to open before the time. Almoſt all big-bellied Women are ſo infatued with the cuſtom to bleed when they are half gone, and in the ſeventh month, that if they ſhould neglect it, (although they were otherwiſe well) they vvould never believe they could be well delivered. I will not in the mean time juſtifie and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:171433:45"/>
make them believe by that, what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith in his 31th Aphoriſm of his 5th Book, <hi>Mulier in utero ferens, ſecta vena abortit, eoque magis ſi ſit fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus grandior.</hi> If (ſaith he) a Woman be blooded, ſhe miſcarries; and the rather, if ſhe be far gone. This Aphoriſm muſt not prohibit us the uſe of bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the caſe requires, but only warns us to uſe it with great prudence; foraſmuch as ſome Women want bleeding three or four times, yea, and oftner ſometimes, whilſt they are with Child, when twice may be ſufficient to others: For as there have been ſome that have been blooded nine or ten times for diſeaſes during their pregnancy, and yet go on with their Infant to their full account; ſo others have miſcarried by bleeding but once a little too copiouſly, as in this Aphoriſm ſpeaks <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> Now ſince all are not of the ſame nature, they muſt not be all governed after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor believe that it is neceſſary to bleed all big-bellied Women; one may judge of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity according as they are more or leſs ſanguine. It is the ſame in purging, which ought to be prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adminiſtred as well as bleeding, according to the exigency of the caſe, uſing alwayes gentle and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign remedies when they are neceſſary; as <hi>Caſſia, Rhubarb, Manna,</hi> with the weight of a dram or two at moſt of good <hi>Senna.</hi> Theſe Purgatives may ſerve turn for a Woman with Child, ſhe ought not to uſe others more violent: If ſhe obſerves all that we have above mentioned, ſhe may then hope for a good iſſue of her great-Belly.</p>
               <p>Having amply enough declared, how a Woman with Child ſhould be governed when accompanied with no ill accident, and given the Rules ſhe ought
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:171433:46"/>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> The means to prevent the many Accidents, which happen to a Woman during the whole time of her being with Child; and firſt of Vomitings.</head>
               <p>VOmiting, with the ſuppreſſion of the Terms, is for the moſt part the firſt Accident which happens to Women, and the means by which they themſelves perceive their pregnancy. It is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes cauſed, as is believed, from ill humours col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in the ſtomach, becauſe of this ſtoppage of their Courſes: theſe corrupted humours do often cauſe a depraved appetite in pregnant Women, when either they flow thither, or are there engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; but not this Vomiting which happens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Conception, and which comes by ſucceſſion: it cannot be meant of thoſe which are there afterwards corrupted; but theſe firſt Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings proceed from the ſympathy between the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and the Womb, becauſe of the ſimilitude of their ſubſtance, and by means of the Nerves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the upper orifice of the Stomach, which have communication by continuity with thoſe that paſs to the Womb, being portions of the ſixth pair of thoſe of the Brain. Now the Womb, which hath a very exquiſite ſenſe, becauſe of its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous compoſition, beginning to wax bigger,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:171433:46"/>
feels ſome pain, which being at the ſame time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by this continuity of Nerves to the upper orifice of the Stomach, cauſe there theſe nauſeatings and vomitings which ordinarily happen. And to prove that it is thus in the beginning, and not by pretended ill humours, appears, in that many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vomit from the firſt day of their being with Child, who were in perfect health before they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, at which time the ſuppreſſion of the Terms could not cauſe this Accident, which proceedeth from this ſympathy in the very ſame manner; as we ſee thoſe that are wounded in the Head and Bowels, and that have the Stone-Cholick, are troubled with Loathings and Vomitings, and yet have no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humours in the ſtomach. Loathings and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, which are motions of the ſtomach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature, happen to big-bellied Women from the beginning, for the reaſons above recited.</p>
               <p>Loathing or Nauſeouſneſs, is nothing but a vain deſire to vomit, and a motion by which the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is raiſed towards the upper orifice, without caſting up any thing. And Vomiting is another more violent endeavour, by which it caſts forth of the mouth what humour ſoever is contained in its capacity. In the beginning Vomiting is but a ſingle ſymptom not to be feared; but continuing a long time, it weakens the ſtomach very much, and hindring digeſtion, corrupts the food inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting it, whence afterwards are engendred thoſe ill humours, which need purging. Theſe Vomitings ordinarily continue to the third or fourth month of being with Child, which is the time the Child ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears manifeſtly to quicken in, after which it begins to ceaſe, and Women to recover the appetite they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:171433:47"/>
had loſt during their being young with Child; becauſe the Infant growing ſtronger and bigger, having need of more nouriſhment, conſumes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of humours, which hinders the flowing of ſo much ſuperfluity to the ſtomach; beſides, at that time the Womb is by degrees accuſtomed to exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It continues in ſome till they are delivered, which often puts them in danger of miſcarrying, and the rather, the nearer the Woman is to her full time. Others again are more ſometimes tormented with it towards the end of their reckoning than at the beginning: becauſe the ſtomach cannot then be ſufficiently widened to contain eaſily the food, being compreſſed by the large extention and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Womb. Such a Vomiting which comes about the latter end of the reckoning to Women whoſe Children lie high, ſeldom ceaſeth before they are brought to bed.</p>
               <p>You need not wonder, or be much troubled at the Vomitings in the beginning, provided they are gentle and without great ſtraining, becauſe they are on the contrary very beneficial to Women; but if they continue longer than the third or fourth month, they ought to be remedied, becauſe the Aliment being daily vomited up, the Mother and the Child, having need of much blood for their nouriſhment, will thereby grow extreamly weak, beſides the continual ſubverſion of the ſtomach, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing great agitation nd compreſſion of the Mothers Belly, will force the Child before its time, as is already mentioned.</p>
               <p>To hinder this Vomiting from afflicting the Woman much or long (it being very difficult to hinder it quite) let her uſe good food, ſuch as is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:171433:47"/>
ſpecified before in the Rules or Diet; but little at a time, that the ſtomach may contain it without pain, and not be conſtrained to vomit it up, as it muſt when they take too much, becauſe the big-belly hinders the free extenſion of it; and for to comfort and ſtrengthen it (being alwayes weak) let her ſeaſon her meat with the Juice of Orenges, Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Pomegranets, or a little Verjuce or Roſe-Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, according to her appetite. She may take likewiſe a Decoction made of French-Barley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower, or good Wheat-flower, having dryed the flower a little before in an Oven, mixing the yolk of an Egg with it, which is very nouriſhing and of eaſie digeſtion: ſhe may likewiſe eat after her meals a little Marmalade of Quinces, or the Jelly of Goosberries; let her Drink be good old Wine, rather Claret than White, being well mixed with good running Fountain-Water, and not that which hath been long kept in Ciſterns, as is moſt of the Water of our Fountains of <hi>Paris,</hi> which acquire by that ſtay an evil quality: If ſhe cannot get ſuch freſh Waters, let her rather uſe River-Water taken up in a place free from filth, in which ſhe may ſometimes quench hot Iron: Above all, let her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear all fat Meats and Sauces, for they extreamly moiſten and ſoften the Membranes of the Stomach, which are already weak enough, and relaxed by the Vomitings, as alſo all ſweet and ſugered Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are not convenient for her, but rather ſuch as are a little ſharp, with which it is delighted and comforted.</p>
               <p>But if notwithſtanding theſe Precautions, and this regular Dyet, the Vomiting (as it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens) continues ſtill, although the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:171433:48"/>
be above half gone, it is a clear ſign there are corrupt humours cleaving to the inward ſides of the Stomach, which being impoſſible to be evacuated by ſo many preceding Vomitings, becauſe they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here ſo faſt, muſt be purged away by Stool, to effect which they need a Diſſolvent, which may be a gentle Purge, made by infuſing half a dram of Rhubarb, a dram or two at moſt of good Senna, and an ounce of Syrup of Succory; which Purge diſſolves the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and in evacuating them, comforts the parts: Or, it may be made with young Mallows, <hi>Caſſia,</hi> Tamarinds, or any other gentle Purgers, according as the caſe requires, alwayes adding a little Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, or compound Syrup of Succory; obſerving likewiſe what humours ought to be purged: For, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, in the 12th Aphoriſm of his firſt Section, <hi>In perturbationibus ventris, &amp; vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus ſponte evenientibus, ſi quidem qualia oportet purgari, purgentur, confert &amp; facile ferunt: ſin mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus contra, &amp;.</hi> In perturbations and dejections of the Belly, and in ſpontaneous Vomitings, if the matter be purg'd away, which ought to be, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient finds eaſe and comfort: if not, the contrary. Therefore we are to conſider, that it is not enough to purge, unleſs we evacuate the peccant humours; for otherwiſe purging more weakens the Stomach, which it would not if it were well ordered, and convenient to evacuate the vicious humour. If once be not ſufficient, it may be repeated, giving the Woman ſome few dayes reſpit between both; if the Vomiting continues daily, almoſt without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, although the Woman obſerves a good dyet, and after that ſhe hath been reaſonably well purged, we muſt reſt there, leſt ſomething worſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:171433:48"/>
happen, of which we may incur the blame; for ſhe is then in great danger of miſcarrying: and when the Hiccough takes them through emptineſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from too much evacuation, cauſed by theſe continual vomitings, it is very bad, as the third Aphoriſm of the ſecond Book teacheth us, <hi>A Vomitu ſingultus malum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some adviſe, that after all theſe things have been tryed in vain, great Cupping-glaſſes ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the region of the ſtomach, to keep it firm in its place: but I believe it to be a Chip in Pottage, which doth neither good nor hurt; becauſe the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is looſe, and no wayes adhering to this upper part of the belly: but ſince theſe Vomitings cool it, and daily weaken it, I ſhould adviſe a big-bellied Woman to wear in the Winter, upon its region, a good piece of warm Serge, or ſoft Lambskin, which would a little warm thoſe parts, and help digeſtion, which is alwayes weak. The <hi>Italians</hi> have a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, which is not bad; they wear to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a fair piece of Stuff under their Doublets upon the region their ſtomach, of which they are ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that if they ſhould leave it off but two dayes in the Winter, nay even in the Summer, they would think themſelves ſick; and they are ſo grear lovers, and ſo curious of it, that this Stomacher is often their greateſt bravery, enriching it with Gold and Silver Embroidery, and Ribonds of very fine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
               <p>We have diſcourſed enough about Vomiting cauſed by Pregnancy, wherefore we will paſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to ſome other Accidents.</p>

               <p>ALL theſe Accidents are but the effects of the dilatation of the Womb, and the compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it makes by its greatneſs and weight on the neighbouring parts; which are much greater the firſt time the Woman is with Child than after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when the Womb only receives the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions it had already before: but when it hath not yet been dilated, it is more ſenſible of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and the ligaments, which hold it in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſcituation, ſuffer a greater ſtreſs in the firſt pregnancy, having never before been forced to lengthen to anſwer the extent of the Womb, than in the following Great-Bellies, to which it obeys more eaſily the ſecond time.</p>
               <p>Theſe ligaments, as well round as large, cauſe theſe pains, being much ſtraitned and drawn by the bigneſs and weight of the Womb, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Child, to wit, the large ones, thoſe of the back and loyns, which anſwer to the reins, becauſe theſe two ligaments are ſtrongly faſtened towards theſe parts; the round ones cauſe thoſe of the groins, ſhare, and thighs, where they terminate. They are ſometimes ſo violently extended by this extream bigneſs and great weight of the Womb, eſpecially of the firſt Child (as I ſaid before) that they are lacerated and torn, being not able to yeeld or ſtretch any farther, and chiefly if the Woman in that condition makes a falſe ſtep, which cauſeth in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:171433:49"/>
them almoſt inſupportable pains, and other worſe accidents; as it happened two years ſince to a near Kinſwoman of mine, who being ſix months gone, or thereabouts, of her firſt Child, felt the like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had ſtumbled, and perceived at the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſomething crack in her Belly towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Reins and Loins, which was one of theſe large ligaments, with a kind of noiſe, by the ſudden jolt ſhe received. At the ſame inſtant ſhe felt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream pains in her Reins and Loins, and all the one ſide of her Belly, which made her immediately vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit very often with much violence, and the next day ſhe was taken with a great continued Feaver, which laſted ſeven or eight dayes, without being able to ſleep or reſt one hour, all which time ſhe continued to vomit all ſhe took, with a ſtrong and frequent Hiccough, having alſo great pains, which ſeemed as if they would haſten her Labour, which (for her ſake) I was very apprehenſive of, as alſo of her death: but with the help of God, having put her immediatly to bed, where ſhe continued twelve whole dayes, in which time I bled her thrice in her Arm on ſeveral dayes, and made her take at two ſeveral times a ſmall grain of <hi>Laudanum</hi> in the yolk of an Egg, a little to eaſe her violent pains by giving her reſt, alwayes ordering her from time to time good ſtrengthning Cordials; all theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which at firſt ſeemed deſperate, ceaſed by little and little, and ſhe went on her full time, when ſhe was happily delivered of a Son, which lived fifteen months notwithſtanding all thoſe miſchievous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents ſhe met with, which were enough to have kill'd half a dozen others: but God ſometimes is pleaſed to work Miracles by Nature, aided with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:171433:50"/>
Remedies fit for the purpoſe, as well as by his Grace.</p>
               <p>This Hiſtory informs us (I think) very well how theſe Pains of the Loins, Back, and Reins come; and the pregnant Womb cauſeth alſo thoſe of the Hips by its greatneſs and weight, in compreſſing them, and bearing too much upon them. There is nothing will eaſe all theſe ſorts of Pains better, than to reſt in Bed, and bleed in the Arm, if there were any great extenſion or rupture of any ligament of the Womb, as was in the caſe recited: And when the Womb bears and weighs too much upon the Hips, if the Woman cannot keep her Bed, ſhe ought to ſupport and comfort her Belly with a broad Swaith well fitted for the purpoſe, and to bear it as patiently as ſhe can to the time of her Labour, which will free her from all theſe accidents.</p>

               <p>AS ſoon as a Woman conceives, her Tearms wanting the ordinary evacuation, the paſſages being ſtopt, and the Woman breeding daily blood, there is a neceſſity, ſhe conſuming but little whilſt young with Child, the fruit being yet very little alſo, that the veſſels which are too full, ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge part, as it doth upon the parts diſpoſed to receive it, ſuch as are the kernels, and glandulous parts, eſpecially the Breaſts, which imbibe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a great quantity of it, which filling and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:171433:50"/>
ſwelling them, cauſeth this Pain in them, which Women feel when they are with Child, and happens alſo to thoſe whoſe Terms are only ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>In the beginning we ought to leave the whole work to Nature, and the Woman muſt only have a care ſhe receives no blows upon thoſe parts, which are then very tender, nor be ſtraight laced with her Bodies, or other ſtiff Waſtcoats, that might bruiſe and wound her; upon which follow Inflamations and <hi>Abſceſs:</hi> But after the third or fourth month of going with Child, the blood being ſtill ſent to the Breaſts in great abundance, 'tis much better to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate it by bleeding in th'Arm, than to turn or drive it back on ſome other part of the Body by repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive or aſtringent Medicines; becauſe it cannot flow to any part, where it can do leſs hurt, than in theſe. Wherefore I ſhould rather prefer the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being very plethorick, to evacuation, by bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Arm, than any other way, becauſe of ſhunning thereby the Accident, of which ſpeaks <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his 40th Aphoriſm of the 5th Book, <hi>Quibus Mulierilbus in Mammas ſanguis colligitur, furorem ſignificat:</hi> If the blood be carried in too great abundance to the Breaſts, it ſignifies that the Woman is in danger of being frantick, becauſe of the tranſport which may be made thence to the Brain; which accident is avoided by moderate bleeding in the Arm, as alſo by a regular cooling dyet, moderately nouriſhing, for to diminiſh the quantity, and temper the heat of the humours of the whole habite.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of Incontinence, and difficulty of Urine.</head>
               <p>THe ſcituation of the Bladder, which is placed juſt upon the Womb, is ſufficient to inſtruct us wherefore pregnant Women are ſometimes troubled with difficulty of urine, and the reaſon why they cannot often hinder, nor ſcarce retain their water; which is cauſed two wayes: 1. Becauſe the Womb with Child by its bigneſs and weight compreſſeth the Bladder, ſo that it is hindred from having its ordinary extenſion, and ſo incapable of containing a reaſonable quantity of urine: Which is the cauſe that the bigger the Woman grows, and the nearer her time ſhe approaches, the oftner ſhe is compelled to make water, which for that reaſon they cannot keep. 2. If the weighty burden of the Womb doth very much compreſs the bottom of the Bladder, it forceth the Women to make water every moment: but contrarily, if the neck of it be preſſed, it is filled ſo extreamly with urine, which ſtayes there with great pain, being not able to expel it, foraſmuch as the Sphincter, becauſe of this compreſſion, cannot be opened to let it out. Sometimes alſo the urine by its acrimony excites the Bladder very often by prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, to diſcharge it ſelf; and ſometimes by its heat it makes an inflamation in the neck of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which cauſeth its ſuppreſſion. It may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that this Accident is cauſed by ſome Stone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Bladder; then the pains of it are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:171433:51"/>
inſupportable, and much more dangerous to Woman with Child, than to one that is not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Womb by its ſwelling cauſeth perpetually the ſtone to preſs againſt the Bladder; and ſo much the violenter are theſe pains, as the ſtone is greater, or the figure of it unequal and ſharp.</p>
               <p>It is of great conſequence to hinder theſe violent and frequent endeavours of a big-bellied Woman to make water, and to remedy it, if poſſible, both in one and the other indiſpoſitions; becauſe by long continuance of alwayes forcing downwards to make water, the Womb is looſned and bears very much down, and ſometimes is forced (the inconvenience not ceaſing) to diſcharge it ſelf of its burden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ordinary time. This is that ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be hindred, having reſpect to the different cauſe of the diſtemper; as when it comes from the bigneſs and weight of the Womb, preſſing the Bladder, as it is for the moſt part: the Woman may remedy it, and eaſe her ſelf, if when ſhe would make water, ſhe lift up with both her hands the bottom of her belly: ſhe may wear a large Swaith accommodated to this uſe, which will bear it up if there be occaſion, and hinder it from bearing too much upon the Bladder; or, to do better, ſhe may keep her Bed.</p>
               <p>If it be the acrimony of the urine that makes the inflammation on the neck of the Bladder, it may be appeaſed by a regular cooling dyet, drinking only <hi>Ptiſan,</hi> and forbearing the uſe of Wine, and all ſorts of Purgations, becauſe they ſend the filth of the whole body to the part affected, and by their heat do yet more augment the acrimony and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but ſhe will do well to uſe, mornings and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:171433:52"/>
evenings, Emulſions made with the cold Seeds, or Whey mixt with Syrup of Violets. This Remedy is proper, by refreſhing gently, to cleanſe the urina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſages, without prejudicing either the Mother or Infant. If the inflammation and acrimony of the Urine be not removed by this Rule of Dyet, they may let her blood a little in the Arm, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, any ill accident that may happen: they may likewiſe bath her outward entry of the neck of her Bladder with a Decoction of emollient and cooling Herbs, as the leaves of Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Pellitory, and Violets, with a little Linſeed, which being viſcous, will help the conduit of the Urine to dilate it ſelf the eaſier; there may be alſo Injections given into the Bladder of the ſame Decoction, to which may be added Honey of Violets, or elſe of lukewarm Milk.</p>
               <p>But if the Woman, notwithſtanding ſhe obſerves theſe Directions, cannot make water, recourſe muſt be had to the laſt remedy, which is, to draw it forth by a Catheter, repreſented and marked with the Letter M in the Table of Inſtruments, at the end of the ſecond Book, which being anointed with Oyl Olive, or ſweet Almonds, having firſt lifted up and thruſted the Belly a little upwards, muſt be gently introduced by the urinary paſſages into the very hollow of the Bladder, and then the Urine will immediately paſs away; which being finiſhed, the Catheter muſt be taken forth, and if the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion continues, it may be uſed again in the ſame manner until the accident quite leave her, and then they may try whether ſhe can urine naturally. If ſhe be in very great extremity, ſhe may uſe an half-Bath luke-warm, provided ſhe be not too much
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:171433:52"/>
moved by this Remedy, abſtaining alſo from all Diureticks, which are very prejudicial to big-bellied Women, becauſe they provoke abortion. If on the other ſide, this evil ariſes from the Stone, which preſenting it ſelf to the neck of the Bladder, ſtops the urinary paſſage, whilſt with Child; ſhe muſt be contented to have it only thruſt back with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter: but if it be ſmall, one may try to draw it forth with a ſmall Probe fit for the purpoſe, putting the fore-finger into the <hi>Vagina,</hi> to keep it in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that it recoyl not back towards the Bladder, which is only to be done to the ſmall ones; for ſhe muſt be delivered before the great ones can be drawn forth, it being better to leave her in that condition, than to endanger her life or the Childs, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Cough, and difficult breathing.</head>
               <p>WOmen whoſe Children lie low, are oftener troubled with difficulty of Urine (as we have mentioned in the foregoing Chapter) than they whoſe Children lie higher, who are indeed exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this and the like inconvenience, but are then more ſubject to a Cough and difficulty of breathing than the former.</p>
               <p>A Cough, if violent, as ſometimes, even to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, is one of the moſt dangerous accidents, which contributes to Abortion, becauſe it is an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay by which the Lungs endeavour to caſt forth of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:171433:53"/>
the Breaſt that which offends them, by a compreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all its Muſcles, which preſſing all the incloſed air inwards, with which the Lungs are much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, thruſts alſo by the ſame means with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den violence the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> downwards, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all the parts of the lower Belly, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Womb of the pregnant Woman, which accident continuing long and violent, often cauſeth her to come before her time.</p>
               <p>This Cough proceeds ſometimes from ſharp and biting rheumes, which diſtill from the brain upon the ſharp Artery and the Lungs, and ſometimes from a blood of the like nature, which flowes from the whole habit towards the Breaſt, upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Terms; as alſo from having breathed in too cold an air, which irritates the parts, and excites them to move in that manner; but being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by theſe cauſes, it is very often augmented by the compreſſion the Womb of the pregnant Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man makes upon the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> which cannot have its free liberty in thoſe that bear their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren high, becauſe by its great extenſion it bears up almoſt all the parts of the lower Belly towards the Breaſt, and principally the Stomach and Liver, forcing them againſt the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> which is thereby compreſſed, as we have ſaid.</p>
               <p>This may be remedied by the Womans obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a good diet ſomething cooling: if ſharp hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours cauſe it, avoiding all meats ſalted, ſpiced, or <hi>hautgouſt;</hi> ſhe muſt forbear ſharp things, as Oren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Citrons, Pomgranats, Vinegar, and others of the like nature, becauſe they yet more and more by their pricking quality excite the Cough: but ſhe may make uſe of Lenitives and ſuch as ſweeten the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:171433:53"/>
paſſages, as juice of Liquoriſh, Sugarcandy, and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Violets, or Mulberries, of which they may mix ſome ſpoonfuls with a <hi>Ptyſan</hi> made with Juju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, Sebeſtens, Raiſons of the Sun and French Barly, alwayes adding a little Liquoriſh to it: It may not likewiſe be amiſs to turn the abundance of theſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and draw them downwards by ſome gentle Clyſter. If this regimen prevails nothing, and that there appears ſigns of fulneſs of blood, it will be neceſſary, at whatſoever time it be of her going with Child, to bleed her in the Arm, and though this remedy be not uſually practiſed when they are young with Child, yet in this caſe it muſt: for a continual Cough is much more dangerous than mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate bleeding. If the Cough comes of cold, let her be kept in a cloſe Chamber with a Napkin three or four times double about her Neck, or a Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkin, that it may keep her warm; and going to bed let her take three or four ſpoonfuls of Syrup of burnt Wine, which is very pectoral, and cauſeth a good digeſtion, if it be made in the following manner:</p>
               <p>Take half a pint of good Wine, two drams of good Cinamon bruiſed, half a dozen Cloves, with four ounces of Sugar; put them together in a Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Porenger, and cauſe them to boil upon a Chafin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh of coals, burn it, and afterwards boil it to the conſiſtence of a Syrup, which let the Woman take at night, an hour or two after a light ſupper. It muſt alwayes be obſerved from whatſoever cauſe the Cough proceeds, that the Woman go looſe in her clothes, for being ſtrait-laced, the Womb is the more thruſt down, by the endeavours the Cough cauſeth it to make. And becauſe ſleep is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſtay defluxions, it may be procured (if there
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:171433:54"/>
be occaſion) by ſome ſmall Julip uſing by no means the ſtrong Stupeſactives, which are dangerous to a Woman with Child, if there be not a very great nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſity, as there was in my Kinſwoman, who had furious accidents by the hurt ſhe got from the ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of which I gave you an account in the 12th Chapter of this Book.</p>
               <p>There are Women that carry their Children ſo high (eſpecially their firſt, becauſe the large Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſupport the Womb are not yet relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that they think them to be in their Breaſt, which cauſeth ſo great an oppreſſion and difficulty of breathing, that they fear they ſhall be choaked aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as they have either eaten a little, walked, or gone up a pair of Stairs: which comes (as I ſaid before) by reaſon the Womb is much enlarged, and greatly preſſeth the Stomach and the Liver, which forces the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> upwards, leaving it no free liberty to be moved, whence is cauſed this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of breathing. Sometimes alſo their Lungs are ſo full of blood, which is driven thither from all parts of the body when with Child, that it hardly leaves paſſage for the air: if ſo, they will breath more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſoon as a little blood is taken from the Arm, becauſe by that means the Lungs are emptied and have more liberty to be moved: But if this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing comes from a compreſſion made by the Womb againſt the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> in forcing the parts of the lower Belly againſt it; the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is to wear their clothes looſe about them; and rather eat little and often, than to fill their Bellies too much at once: becauſe it is thereby more preſſed againſt the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and ſo augments the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Neither muſt ſhe uſe any viſcous or windy
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:171433:54"/>
meats, as Peaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only ſuch as are of an eaſie digeſtion: ſhe muſt all the while avoid any occaſion of grief and fear, becauſe theſe two paſſions drive the blood to the Heart and Lungs in too great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, ſo that the Woman, who can hardly alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy breath, and hath her Breaſt ſtuft, will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being ſuffocated: for the abundance of blood filling at once and above meaſure the Ventricles of the Heart, hinders its motion, without which one cannot live.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the ſwelling and pains of the Thighs and Legs.</head>
               <p>IT is very eaſie for them that are acquainted with the Circulation of the Blood, to conceive the reaſon why many big-bellied Women have their Legs and Thighs ſwelled and pained, and ſometimes full of red ſpots, from the ſwelling of the Veins, all along the inſide of them, which extreamly hinders their going. Many think (which is in ſome meaſure true) that the Woman having more Blood than the Infant needs for its nouriſhment, Nature, by vertue of the expulſive faculty of the upper parts, which are alwayes moſt ſtrong, drives the ſuperfluity of it upon the lower, which are the Legs, as moſt feeble and apteſt to receive it, becauſe of their ſcituation: to explain it thus is ſomething to purpoſe; but I think the Circulation. of the Blood will teach us better how this comes, than that we need to have recourſe to this expulſive faculty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:171433:55"/>It is then thus, according to my opinion, Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordinary motion of the Blood, the Crural and the Saphene Veins receive into them what is brought to the lower parts by the Arteries, and convey it along the Leg and Thigh, aſcending ſtill by the <hi>Iliacks</hi> towards the Heart, which are empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, into the <hi>Cava,</hi> to aſcend again by it to the Heart, and ſo ſucceſſively. This being ſo <hi>de facto</hi> (as need not be doubted, ſince it is a verity founded upon experience) when a Woman is with Child, and chiefly towards the laſt months, and the Womb is much extended, and poſſeſſeth a great part of the lower Belly, then it begins to preſs the Iliack Veins by its greatneſs and heavineſs, and ſo hinders the Blood, from following its courſe, and having its motion ſo free, as before ſhe was with Child; which being ſo, the inferior parts, which are the Crural and Saphene Veins, become ſwelled, much in the ſame manner as the Veins of the Arm do upwards when bound with a Ligature for bleeding, or by any ſtrong compreſſion upon the upper parts; which happens, becauſe the Veins being compreſſed, the Blood is there ſtopt, finding its paſſage more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. The Iliack Veins being then ſo preſſed by the bigneſs and heavineſs of the Womb, all thoſe of the Legs and Thighes ſwell in ſuch a manner, as that they empty themſelves into the ſubſtance of the parts, and throughout the five Coverings, which thence become ſwelled; yea and theſe Veins, and amongſt the reſt the Saphenes, dilated and become varicoſe, ſometimes from the inward and upper parts of the Thigh to the very extremity of the Foot, in which the Blood ſtagnating without its free circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is altered and corrupted, which cauſeth great
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:171433:55"/>
pains and ſwellings in all theſe parts. This oftner befalls Women that are very ſanguine, walk much, and uſe great exerciſe, which aided with a fulneſs of the Vein, makes a rupture of the Valvules, which ſerve to facilitate the motion of the Blood; as the ſuckers of a Pump, which retain the water when it is raiſed thither: which Blood falling down again, not being ſo ſupported, cauſeth by its quantity and ſtay, theſe dilatations of the Veins, which are called <hi>Varices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For to remedy this, when a Woman hath her Veins dilated, let her only uſe, whilſt ſhe is with Child, a palliative cure, in ſwaithing this <hi>Varicos</hi>-part with a ſwaith three or four fingers broad, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the bigneſs of it, beginning to ſwaith from the bottom, and conducting it upwards to the beginning of the <hi>Varices,</hi> that by this means theſe <hi>varicos</hi> Veins, which are alwayes outward, being moderately cloſed, ſhould be hindred by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from further dilating, and the Blood not be corrupted by the ſtay it makes there, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this will not want its circular motion, becauſe the greateſt part of it paſſeth then by the Veſſels deeper placed. A Woman in this condition ſhould likewiſe keep her bed, if ſhe can, becauſe by this ſcituation, her body being equally layed, the Blood circulates much the eaſier, and is not then ſo much troubled to return by theſe Veins to the Heart, as when it muſt aſcend by them, the Woman ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upright; which is the cauſe the Legs alwayes are more ſwell'd at night than mornings: if there be in any other parts of the Body ſigns of plenitude and abundance of Blood, they may bleed her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:171433:56"/>There are other Women, whoſe Legs only ſwell becauſe of their weakneſs, and not for the reaſon juſt above mentioned, and are ſo <hi>oedematous,</hi> that when you preſs them with your Finger, the print of it remains there; which is, becauſe they want natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat ſufficient to concoct and digeſt all the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, ſent to them, and to expell the ſuperfluities of it, which by that means remaining there in great quantity, leaves them ſo <hi>oedematous.</hi> For, to reſolve theſe ſort of Tumours, you may uſe a Lee made with the Aſhes of Vines, and the Decoction of Melilot, Camomile and Lavender; afterwards they may be ſomented with Aromatick Wine, in which they may moiſten their compreſſes to be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, repeating them three or four times a day to fortifie them; which may be made with Roſemary, Bayes, Tyme, Marjoram, Sage, and Lavender, of each an handful; of Province-Roſes half a handful, Pomegranat flowers and Alum, each an ounce; boil them together in ſtrong Red-Wine, three pints, to the conſumption of a third part, ſtrain it, and keep it for the uſe above mentioned. But ſince Pregnancy for the moſt part cauſeth theſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, they likewiſe ordinarily ceaſe when the Woman is brought to bed, becauſe then ſhe purgeth forth the ſuperfluity of her whole habit by means of her <hi>Lochia.</hi>

               <p>THe menſtrous Blood, that uſed to be purged away every month, being collected in a great quantity near the Womb (which permits it not now to be evacuated by the uſual paſſage, being ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſed during Pregnancy) is forced to flow back into the whole habit, and chiefly upon the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts of the Womb, and cauſeth in many the Hemorrhoids both internal and external. All the ſeveral ſorts of them, which we ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, may as well happen to them at this time as at another: but we will only ſpeak of that ſort which is cauſed by pregnancy, becauſe our deſign is only to make known ſome particulars of the maladies Women are in this condition ſubject to.</p>
               <p>Hemorrhoids are tumours and painful inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ingendred by a flux of humours upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the Hemorrhoid Veins and Arteries, and are cauſed in great-bellied Women by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Blood which is caſt upon theſe parts, becauſe the body at this time is not purged of its ſuperfluities, as it was accuſtomed before: It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very often cauſed by the great endeavours that Women ſometimes make to go to ſtool when they are coſtive; becauſe the Womb being placed upon the <hi>Rectum,</hi> hinders by preſſing it, the excrements contained in it from being eaſily extruded; and by theſe endeavours the Blood, which is in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Veſſels, being likewiſe expreſſed, ſwells and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:171433:57"/>
blows up their extremities, upon which comes theſe painful inflamations, call'd Hemorrhoids, of which ſome are internal, ſome external, ſome ſmall and with little or no pain, and ſome extreamly big and painful. This may ſuffice for their general differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without coming to their particulars, which would require a more ample explication.</p>
               <p>If they are ſmall and without pain, either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or external, it is eaſie enough to prevent their further growth, by Remedies, which hinder and turn the flux from thoſe parts: but there is more reaſon to cure the great and painful ones, by eaſing firſt the great pain, for as long as that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the Flux is ever augmented. To this purpoſe, if the big-bellied Woman have in the reſt of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy other ſigns of repletion, ſhe may ſafely be once let blood in the Arm, and ſometimes (if there be great neceſſity) twice, for to turn away the humours, and to evacuate the fulneſs, by which the pain will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be appeaſed: If the groſs excrements retained in the right Gut be the cauſe of it, and that ſhe be coſtive, let her take an emollient Clyſter of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Mallows, Marſhmallows, Pellitory, and Violets, with Hony of Violets, to which may be added, Oyl of ſweet Almonds, or ſweet Butter; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careful to add nothing that may irritate, leſt it augment the Diſeaſe, eſpecially when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Piles: And to the end the Women may then the better receive the Clyſter, tis fit that a ſmall end of a Pullets gut be put upon the end of the pipe, to cover it on the outſide, that ſo it may be put up the Fundament with leſs pain, afterwards let her keep a moderate and cooling diet, and continue in bed till this flux of humours be paſſed, and the mean
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:171433:57"/>
time anoint the Piles with hot ſtroakings from the Cow, or foment them with the Decoction of Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows, White-broth, and Linſeed: Oil of ſweet Almonds, Poppies, and Water-Lillies well beaten together with the yolk of an Egg, and ground in a leaden Mortar, are very anodine and proper to eaſe pain; and if the inflammation be great, anoint it a little with <hi>Uuguentum Refrigerans Galeni,</hi> and <hi>Populean,</hi> equally mixed.</p>
               <p>After a good diet, bleeding, and the application only of theſe cooling and anodine Remedies (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percuſſives being not then to be uſed, leſt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the impure Blood, or harden the Piles) if their ſwelling doth not abate, Leeches muſt be applied, to draw and empty the Blood there gathered; or they may be opened with a Lancet, if ſoft, or any kind of inundation: but Leeches is more proper for hard Piles, and as it were fleſhy, becauſe they do not put one to ſo much pain as the Lancet: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome men by the help of theſe Piles, have an evacuation, almoſt natural, being relieved by it when they bleed moderately, Nature being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to it: yet it is not ſo in Women, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes contrary to Nature; becauſe the evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which happens to thoſe men by the Piles, ought always to be made by the Womb in Women, if not with Child: but if they are, it may in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in caſe the Woman be plethorick, ſupply al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the defect of the natural; for, provided they bleed moderately and without pain, ſhe may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be alſo relieved: but if they flow in too great quantity, there is danger that both Mother and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant will be weakened by it; and to avoid it, 'tis convenient to make aſtringent Fomentations with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:171433:58"/>
the Decoction of Granat flowers, the rinds of Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates and Province-Roſes, made with Smiths<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water and a little Alum; or this Cataplaſm may be applyed to it, made with Bole-armonack, Dragons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood, and <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> with the white of an Egg: As alſo to turn back the Blood from theſe parts by bleeding in the Arm, and by dry cupping-glaſſes, applied to the region of the Reines, and other remedies convenient for this diſtemper, and ſuch as the accident requires.</p>

               <p>THree ſeveral Fluxes may befall a great-bellied Woman, to wit, the Flux of the Belly, the Flux of the Terms, and Floodings. We ſhall firſt ſpeak of the Flux of the Belly, and afterwards we will examine the other two, in the two following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>There are ordinarily reckoned three ſorts of Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which in general is a frequent dejection of what is contained in the Guts, by ſtool: the firſt is called <hi>Lienteria,</hi> by which the Stomach and the Guts, not having digeſted the nouriſhments received, lets it paſs almoſt quit raw. The ſecond is called <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> by which they ſimply diſcharge the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and excrements which they contain. And the third, which is the worſt, is <hi>Dyſenteria,</hi> by which the Patient, together with the humours and excrements, voids Blood with violent pains, cauſed by the ulceration of the Guts.</p>

                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:171433:58"/>Of what kind ſoever the Flux is, if it be great, and continue long, it puts the Woman in great danger of miſcarrying; which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> tells us in the 34th Aphoriſm of his 5th Book: <hi>Mulieri in utero gerenti, ſi alvus plurimum profluat, periculum eſt ne abortiat.</hi> For, if it be a <hi>Lienteria,</hi> the Stomach not containing the Food received, and letting it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly paſs away before it be turned into Chyle, of which Blood ought to be made for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mother and Child, it is not poſſible but they muſt be both thereby extreamly weakned for want of nouriſhment: If it be a <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues long, it will occaſion the ſame accident; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a great diſſipation of the Spirits, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the evacuation of humours: But the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is much greater when a <hi>Dyſenteria,</hi> foraſmuch as the Woman hath then great pains and gripes in the Guts cauſed by their ulceration, which excites them continually by conſtant ſtimulations to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves of the ſharp and bilious humours, with which they are extreamly annoyed; which cauſeth a great diſturbance and violent commotion of the Womb, being placed upon the right Gut; and to the Child contained in it, and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which the Muſcles of the Belly make on all ſides, as alſo thoſe that are made by them of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> which force themſelves down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the endeavours a Woman makes ſo often to go to ſtool with pain, the Child is conſtrained becauſe of this violence to come before its time, which arrives ſo much the oftner, by how much theſe ſtimulations and needings are greater, as the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> notes in the 27th Aphoriſm of his 7th Book, <hi>Mulieri utero gerenti, ſi tentio ſuperve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerit,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:171433:59"/>
facit abortum.</hi> If there happens a teneſme (ſaith he) to a Woman with Child, it make her miſcarry. This teneſme is a great paſſion of the right Gut, which forceth it to make theſe violent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to diſcharge it ſelf, without being able to avoid any thing, but cholerick humors mixt with Blood, with which it is continually irritated.</p>
               <p>When this Flux of the Belly happens to a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellied Woman, it is ordinarily, becauſe they have alwayes the digeſtion of their ſtomach weak, by reaſon of their bad dyet, which their ſtrange appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites cauſe them often to long for: by the continual uſe of which being at length weakned, it ſuffers the food to paſs immediately without digeſtion; or if it ſtay longer, it is converted into a corrupted Chyle, which deſcending into the Guts, irritates them by its acrimony to diſcharge themſelves as ſoon as they can.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed ſafely to the cure of theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Fluxes of the Belly (to which 'tis fit care ſhould be taken in good time, leſt the Woman miſcarry, as we have already ſaid) the nature of it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, to the end the cauſe, which maintains it, ſhould be remedied. If it be a <hi>Lienteria</hi> following (as is uſual) continual Vomitings, which have ſo debilitated the Stomach, and relaxed its membranes, that having no longer ſtrength to vomit up that food, it ſuffers it to paſs downwards without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion: In this caſe a Woman muſt abſtain from all thoſe irregular appetites, and accuſtom her ſelf to good food of eaſie digeſtion, and little at a time, that ſo her Stomach may be able the eaſier to concoct and digeſt it; ſhe ſhould drink a little deep Claret-Wine, mixed with Water in which Iron hath been
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:171433:59"/>
quenched, inſtead of <hi>Ptyſan,</hi> which is not proper in this caſe, provided ſhe have not a ſtrong Feaver; for if it be but a ſmall Feaver, Wine on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is to be preferred, foraſmuch as the fewer ſhe hath at that time, is but ſymptomatick, cauſed by this debility of Stomach, and will vaniſh as ſoon as this is fortified; which will be yet more promoted, if the Woman before and after meals takes ſome Corroberatives, as a little of that Burnt-Wine we mentioned for the Cough in the 15th Chapter of this Book; or a little good Hippocras, or right Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, of any of them according to her pallat; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it be amiſs if ſhe eats a little good Marma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade of Quince before meals: She may likewiſe wear upon the pit of her Stomach a Lamb-skin with the wool, for to preſerve it, and augment its natural heat, which is very neceſſary to digeſt food; obſerving above all, to give no purging Medicine, when this Flux is only cauſed by weakneſs, leſt it be thereby augmented.</p>
               <p>If it be a <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> and only an evacuation ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of ſuch excrements as are retained in the Guts, and ſome ſuperfluous humours, which Nature hath ſent thither to be expelled, and that it continue no long time, and is gentle; the Woman will find no inconvenience by it; nor is ſhe in that danger as when it paſſeth thoſe bounds; and therefore 'tis good to leave the operation to Nature, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting it in the beginning: but if it continues above four or five days, it is a ſign then, that there are ill humours contained and cleaving to the inſide of the Guts, which provoke them often to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and ought to be removed with ſome purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicine that may looſen and evacuate them,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:171433:60"/>
after which the Flux will certainly ceaſe, ſome light infuſion of Senna and Rubarb, with Syrup of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory, or an ounce of <hi>Diacatholicon,</hi> with a little Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb for a Bolus, to be taken in a Waſer.</p>
               <p>But if, notwithſtanding fit purges and a regular diet, this flux continues, and changes into a <hi>Dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria,</hi> the Patient voiding every moment bloody ſtools, with much pain and needing, ſhe is then in great danger of miſcarrying, &amp; its prevention ought it be endeavoured, if poſſible. Therefore, after having purged away the ill humour, (with the Medicines above mentioned) which were in the Guts, and hindering, by a good dyet, that no more be engendred; to which purpoſe let her uſe good broths made of Veal or Chicken, with cooling Herbs, temper the acrimony of theſe hot humours; let her eat Pap with the yolk of an Egg new layed, being well boiled: ſuch dyet ſoftens and ſweetens the Guts within. Let her drink be Water, in which Iron or Steel was quenched, with a little Wine, if ſhe be not feveriſh, for then half a ſpoonful of Syrop of Quince or Pomegranats is better to mix with the foreſaid Water; She may likewiſe eat a little Marmalade of Quince, or other aſtringents and ſtrengtheners, provided her body was well purged before: and becauſe there is always in theſe Fluxes great pains and gripes all over the Belly and Guts, and chiefly the <hi>Rectum,</hi> all the humours being diſcharged upon it, which irritating it extreamly, cauſeth continual ſtimulations, that ought to be appeaſed (if poſſible) to prevent Abortion, and may be effected by Clyſters made of the Broth of a Calves-head, or Sheeps-head well boyled, mixing it with two ounces of the Oyl of Violets, or elſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:171433:60"/>
of good Milk, mixed with the Yolk of a freſh Egg. After the uſe of theſe ſtrengthening and anodine Clyſters, as long as is judged neceſſary, which the Patient ought to keep as long as ſhe can, the better to appeaſe theſe pains, you muſt proceed to the uſe of Deterſives, made with the Decoction of Mallows and Marſh-mallows, with Honey of Roſes; and afterwards Aſtringent Clyſters, in which muſt be neither Oyl nor Honey mixed, becauſe they relax inſtead of binding; beginning firſt with the gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, made with Roſe-water, mixed with Lettice and Plantain-water; afterwards to ſtronger, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with the Decoction of the Roots and Leaves of Plantain, <hi>Tapſus Barbatus,</hi> Horſe-tail, with Provence-Roſes, the rind of Pomegranats in Smiths-water; to which may be added, of <hi>Terra Sigilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and Dragons-blood, each two drachms: You may likewiſe foment the Fundament; but there muſt be care, before you come to uſe the ſtrong Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, that the Woman be firſt well purged with the Remedies before mentioned, leſt (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is) the Wolf be ſhut in with the Flock; and, endeavouring to prevent Abortion, the death of the Mother, and conſequently of the Child, be cauſed by a greater miſchief; retaining within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ill Humours, of which Nature would willingly be diſcharged: All which may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if what I have ſaid be well obſerved.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>HIppocrates,</hi> in the 60th Aphoriſm of his 5th Book ſaith, <hi>Si Mulieri utero gerenti Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones prodeant, impoſſibile eſt foetum eſſe ſanum;</hi> If a big-bellied Woman have her Courſes, it is impoſſible the Infant can be in health. This Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm muſt not be taken literally, but muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood when they come down immoderately: for though, according to the moſt general and natural rule, the Courſes ought not to flow when a Woman is with Child, becauſe their ordinary paſſage is ſtopt, and alſo becauſe the Blood is then imployed for the nouriſhment of the Infant, of which, if it flows away, it is defrauded, and conſequently much weakened: Yet there are ſome Women, who notwithſtanding they are with Child, have their Courſes till the 4th or 5th month; about which time, the Infant being already pretty big, draws a good quantity of blood for its nouriſhment; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there cannot ſo eaſily remain a ſuperfluity, as when young with Child. I knew one that had four or five living Children, and had, of every Child, her Courſes duly from month to month, as at other times, onely in a little leſs quantity, and was ſo till the 6th month; yet notwithſtanding, ſhe was alwayes brought to bed at her full time. I likewiſe ſaw another, who not believing ſhe was with Child, becauſe ſhe had her Courſes; and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:171433:61"/>
finding her ſelf out of order, becauſe ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, imagining it was ſome other Diſtemper, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with her Phyſitian to bleed and purge her very often, which he did, till he had indeed cured her; but 't was after ſhe had miſcarried, being three months gone. This evacuation uſually befalls ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sanguine or Phlegmatick Women, who breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more blood than the Infant hath need of for its nouriſhment at the beginning, diſcharge themſelves at thoſe times of that ſuperfluous quantity, more or leſs, according to their diſpoſitions, but not by the bottom of the Womb, as formerly when they were not breeding, becauſe thoſe paſſages are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually cloſed by the after-birth which adheres to it, and the Womb is then exactly cloſe; but by a couple of Branches which Nature (provident and careful of the preſervation of Individuals, as well as of the Kind) hath deſtined to this uſe, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Spermatick Veſſels, and (beſides thoſe they ſend to the Teſticles and other parts) before they arrive at the Womb, divide themſelves on each ſide into two Branches very conſiderable; of which, the one terminates in the Fund of the Womb, by which the Courſes paſs, when the Woman is not with Child; and the other, not entering there, couching along the body of it, is terminated in the ſide of the neck of the Womb, by which the Courſes are diſcharged, whilſt they are breeding, in caſe the Woman be Plethorick.</p>
               <p>When a Woman voids blood downwards, it muſt carefully be conſidered whence it proceeds, and in what manner; whether it is the ordinary Courſes, or a real Flooding: If it be the ordinary Courſes, the blood comes away periodically at the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:171433:62"/>
accuſtomed times, and flows by degrees from the neck, near the inward Orifice of the Womb, and not from its Fund; as may be diſcovered, if try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a finger one finds the inward Orifice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly cloſed; which could not be, if the blood proceeded from the bottom, as alſo if it proceeds without pain; all which circumſtances do not meet in a flooding, but others very different, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the following Chapter. It muſt likewiſe be conſidered, whether theſe Courſes flow, onely becauſe of the ſuperfluity, or becauſe of the acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Blood, or the weakneſs of the Veſſels which contain it, that ſo fit Remedies may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. If they proceed from the ſole abundance, being more than the Fruit can conſume for its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, it is ſo far from hurting either Mother or Child, that being moderate, it is very profitable to them; becauſe, if the Womb were not diſcharged of this ſuperfluous blood, the Fruit which is as yet but little, would be drowned by it, or, as it were, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated: And if it ſhould chance that they were unduely ſtopt or retained, bleeding will ſupply the defect of the natural evacuation, which ought to have been; but if there be no ſign of abundance or plenitude; and that before ſhe was with Child, ſhe had her Courſes in a ſmall quantity, which ſtill continue to flow, after ſhe hath conceived, it is a ſign that the flux proceeds from the heat and acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the blood, or the weakneſs of the Veſſels appointed to receive it. It is of this ſort of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> pretends to ſpeak, in the 6th <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> before mentioned, whoſe Children can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be healthful, when their Courſes flow, whilſt they are breeding; becauſe there remains not blood
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:171433:62"/>
enough behind for her, and the nouriſhment of her Infant, which puts her in great danger of miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, for as the proverb ſaith, <hi>Hunger drives the Wolf out of the Wood;</hi> ſo likewiſe want of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forceth the little priſoner out of his hiding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place before his time.</p>
               <p>To hinder this Flux from effecting ſo evil and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter an accident, the Woman muſt keep her ſelf very quiet in bed, abſtaining from all things that may heat her Blood, ſhunning Choler above all the paſſions of the mind, uſing a ſtrengthening and a cooling diet, feeding on meat that breeds good Blood, and thickens it; as are good broths made with Poultry; necks of Mutton, knuckles of Veal, in which may be boiled cooling Pot-herbs; newlayd Eggs, Gelly's, Rice-milk, Barly-broths, which are proper for her: let her Drink be Water in which Iorn is quenched, with a little Syrup of Quince: ſhe muſt refrain from Copulation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by heating the Blood it excites it to flow more. If notwithſtanding all this the Flux continues, ſome commend large cupping-glaſſes under the Breaſts to make a revulſion, and to turn the Blood: according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Aphoriſm 50 of the 5th Book, <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieri ſi velis menſtrua ſiſtere, cucurbitulam quam maximam ad Mammas appone:</hi> but it will do no great matter; however, to ſatisfie the Patient, and to ſhew that nothing is omitted that may make for her cure, they may be applied. I ſhould rather chooſe to make this Revulſion by bleeding in the Arme, if her ſtrength permitted: And becauſe in this condition the Child is very weak through this great evacuation, it muſt be fortified by applying to the Mothers Belly about the region of the Womb,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:171433:63"/>
Compreſſes ſteeped in ſtrong Wine, in which is boyled a Pomegranat, with its peel, Provence-Roſes, and a little Cinamon: but the beſt way to ſtrengthen it, is to correct the Mothers Blood, and hinders its evacuation.</p>

               <p>THere is a great difference between the menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood, of which we have diſcourſed in the preceeding chapter, which happens ſometimes to Women with Child, and this Flooding which we have now in hand: for (as I have ſaid) the Courſes come periodically at the times accuſtomed, without pain, deſtilling by little and little from the neck of the Womb, during pregnancy, after which it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ceaſeth: but much the contrary, this loſs of Blood comes from the bottom of the Womb, with pain, and almoſt of a ſudden, and in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and continues flooding daily without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, except that ſome clods (formed there) which ſeem ſomtimes to leſſen the accident, by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for a little time the place whence it flows; but ſoon after it returns with greater violence, after which follows death both to Mother and Child, if not timely prevented, by delivering the Woman, as ſhall be hereafter declared.</p>
               <p>If this Flooding happens when young with Child, it is uſually becauſe of ſome Falſ-concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Mole, of which the Womb endeavours to diſcharge it ſelf, by which it opens ſome of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:171433:63"/>
Veſſels in the bottom of it, from whence the Blood ceaſeth not to flow, until in hath caſt forth the ſtrange bodies it contained in its capacity: and the hotter and ſubtiller the Blood is then, the more abundantly it flows. But when this Flouding hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to a Woman truly conceived, at whatſoever time it be, it proceeds likewiſe from the opening of the Veſſels of the fund of the Womb, cauſed by ſome blow, ſlip or other hurt, and chiefly becauſe the <hi>Secundine</hi> in ſuch caſes, and ſometimes in others, ſeparating in part, if not totally, from the inſide of the bottom of the Womb, to which it ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here, that it might receive the Mothers Blood, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Infants nouriture, by which ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it leaves open all the orifices of the veſſels where it was joyned, and ſo follows a great flux of Blood, which never ceaſeth (if ſo cauſed) till the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be brought to bed: for the <hi>Secundine</hi> being once looſened, although but part of it, never joyns again to the Womb to cloſe thoſe Veſſels, which can never ſhut till the Womb hath voided all that it contained: for then compreſſing and cloſing its ſelf, and as it were entering within it ſelf (as it happens preſently after delivery) the orrifices of the veſſels are cloſed and ſtopt up by this contraction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo this flooding ceaſeth, which alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues as long as the Womb is diſtended by the Child, or any thing elſe it contains, for the reaſon aforeſaid: much like to a Spunge, whoſe pores or holes being very large when ſwelled, diſappear and cloſe with their own ſubſtance when ſqueezed and compreſſed; ſo likewiſe by this contraction of the Matrix (which during pregnancy became as it were ſpongeous) in the place whence the <hi>Secundine</hi> was
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:171433:64"/>
ſeparated, the orifices of the veſſels are cloſed, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as it is cleanſed from whatſoever it contained in its capacity.</p>
               <p>Although I have ſaid that a Woman in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for the reaſons alledged, muſt neceſſarily be delivered, that the Flooding may be ſtopt; I do not intend it ſhould be done aſſoon as perceived: becauſe ſome ſmall Floodings have ſometimes been ſuppreſſed by keeping quietly in bed, bleeding in the Arme, and the uſe of the Remedies ſpecified in the precedent Chapter; it may likewiſe be but an ordinary and menſtruous Flux. If then the Blood flows but in ſmall quantity, and continues a little while, 'tis good leaving the labour to the work of nature, provided the Woman hath ſufficient ſtrength, and that it be accompanied with no other evil acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: but when it flows in ſo great abundance, that ſhe falls into Convulſions and Faintings, then the operation muſt not be defer'd; and 'tis abſolutely neceſſary ſhe ſhould be delivered whether ſhe be at her reckoning or no, whether ſhe have pains or throws, or not; becauſe there is no other way to ſave her life, and the Childs, then preſently to do it. <hi>Extreman fundet cum ſanguine vocem;</hi> ſhe caſts forth with her Blood her laſt breath. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> knew very well the danger of it, when he ſaid in his 56th Aphoriſm of the 5th Book, <hi>In fluxu muliebri ſi convulſio &amp; animi defectus advenerit, malum:</hi> If Convulſions and Faintings follow Floodings, it is a bad ſign.</p>
               <p>There muſt not alwayes in theſe unfortunate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents be expected pains and throws to force and bear down to forward labour; for though they come at the beginning, they uſually ceaſe aſſoon as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:171433:64"/>
the Flooding comes to <hi>Syncope's</hi> and Convulſions; neither muſt it be defer'd, till the Womb be enough opened, foraſmuch as this effuſion of Blood very much moiſtens it, and the weakneſs relaxeth it, ſo that it may be then as eaſily dilated as if there had been abundance of ſtrong throws. Wherefore, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving placed the Woman in the ſituation we ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect when we treat of deliveries, let the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having his hands anointed with Oyle or freſh Butter, introduce his Fingers joyned together, by degrees into the Matrix, and ſpread them open the one from the other when they are in the entry, for to dilate it ſufficiently by little and little, without any violence, if poſſible; which being done, and his hand quite within, if he finds the Waters not broke, let him break them, and then, whatſoever part of the Child preſents, though the Head (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be not juſt in the Birth) let him ſearch for the Feet, and draw it forth by them (obſerving eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry curcumſtance, that ſhall be ſhewen in the 14th Chapter of the ſecond Book, where is deſcribed the way how to deliver a Woman, the Child coming with the Feet firſt) becauſe there is better hold, and more eaſie to deliver by them, than by the Head or any other part of the body. Wherefore if the Feet lie not ready, the Chirurgeon muſt ſeek for them, which at that time is eaſier done than at another, becauſe the great Flooding makes the Womb looſe and ſlippery by its humidity, ſo that it will not be difficult for him to turn the Child and bring it by the Feet, as we have even now ſaid; after which he muſt fetch the after-burthen, which in theſe caſes cleaves but little, being careful not to leave ſo much as a clod in the Womb, leſt it ſtill continue the Flooding,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:171433:65"/>
which being done, it will ſoon after ſtop with all the accidents, if too much time was not ſpent before the operation.</p>
               <p>Many Women and Children have periſhed for want of this operation in this ill accident; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others have eſcaped death, (which elſe moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanly had followed) by being timely ſuccored.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guillimen</hi> in Chap. 13 of his 2d Book of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Deliveries, makes mention of ſix or ſeven Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to confirm this verity, in ſome of which we may find the Women and their Children bloody victims of it, for not having been in the like caſe delivered, which others, by a ſeaſonable delivery, eſcaped: and the better to confirm it by my own experience, I will recite you one amongſt the reſt, very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, of the remembrance of which I am ſo ſenſible, that the Ink I write with at preſent to publiſh it to the World for their propfit, ſeems to me to be Blood, becauſe in this ſad and fatal occaſion, I ſaw part of my ſelf expire.</p>
               <p>About three years ſince one of my Siſters, not yet one and twenty years of age, being about eight months and a half gone with her fifth Child, and then very well in health, was ſo unfortunate as to hurt her ſelf (though at firſt ſmall in appearance) by falling on her Knees, her Belly a little touching the ground by the fall, after which ſhe paſſed a day or two without perceiving any great alteration, which made her neglect to repoſe her ſelf, being very neceſſary for her; but the third day, or thereabouts, after her hurt, about eleven in the morning, ſhe was ſuddenly ſurpriſed with ſtrong and frequent pains in the Belly, which were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly followed with Floodings; this made her
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:171433:65"/>
preſently ſend for her Midwife, who no better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding her Office, told her ſhe muſt have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, till the Womb had dilated it ſelf by the pains, before ſhe could be delivered, aſſuring her further that ſhe had no reaſon to be afraid, and that ſhe ſhould be quickly freed from the danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her Child came right: ſhe made her thus hope in vain three or four hours, until, the Flooding ſtill continuing violently, the pains began to ceaſe, and the poor Woman fell into frequent faintings, and then the Midwife deſired a Chiurgeon to adviſe with in this caſe: they immediately ſent to my houſe for me, but unfortunately miſſing of me, they ſent for him, whom they judged the ableſt of all the Chirurgeons that practiſed Midwifery in <hi>Paris,</hi> and immediatly conducted him to my Siſters, where he arrived about four in the afternoon, and having ſeen her,<note n="*" place="margin">It were to be wiſh'd rather than hoped for, that Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners in this and other the like dangerous caſes (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have no certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) would conſult, and not deſtroy one or more, by undertaking what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well perform, or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Patients from ſending for other help and advice; putting Life in ballance with their Reputation.</note> contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with only ſaying, <hi>ſhe was a dead woman, and that nothing was to be done to her, but to give her all the Sacraments, and that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſhe could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered;</hi> which likewiſe the Midwife joyntly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, who believed that the opinion of a Man ſo authentickly eſteemed of all, muſt be infallible.

with her Childs, if he at that time had delivered her, which was very eaſie to be done, as will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear by the ſequel of the Hiſtory. After the advice of a perſon of ſo great reputation, together with that of the Midwife, ſince Monſieur <hi>N.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The great miſchiefs which happen by the Prognosticks of ſuch who have the luck, though they want the merit to be eſteemed.</note> could do nothing, there was no other remedy for ſo great a danger, but to hope in God alone, who was Almighty. They therefore endeavoured to comfort my poor Siſter as well as they could, who longed for nothing more then to ſee me, to know whether I would paſs the ſame ſentence, and whether her danger, which ſtill augmented more and more, was without remedy (for her Blood flowed away continually in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance) At length I returned home, where they had been long before to tell me this bad news, though by misfortune could not find me (as I ſaid before) which as ſoon as I underſtood, I immediately ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to her with all poſſible ſpeed, where I ſaw aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as I came in, ſo pittiful a ſpectacle, that all the paſſions of my Soul were at the inſtant agitated with many and different commotions; having after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a little recovered my ſenſes, I drew near to my Siſters Bed, where they had juſt given her the laſt Sacraments, and ſhe conjured me very often to give that ſuccour, which ſhe ſaid ſhe only expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from me. After that I had underſtood from the Midwife all that had paſſed, and the opinion of the Chirurgeon, that had ſeen her above two hours before (for it was then ſix a clock) I perceived the Blood
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:171433:66"/>
to flood continually in great abundance and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion, of which ſhe had already loſt above<note n="*" place="margin">French quarts are Engliſh pottles.</note> three quarts: and which was very remarkable, above twelve ſmall Porengers, in the two hours after the Chirurgeon was returned, as it ſeemed to me by the number of Napkins and other Clothes, which were all muck wet with it; which Blood had ſtayed in her body and ſaved her life, if ſhe had been then delivered: I ſaw likewiſe that ſhe grew every moment weaker and weaker, which convinced me that ſhe was then in more danger than ſhe would have been if they had not let ſlipt the opportunity of delivering her two or three hours before, as it was poſſible and eaſie; becauſe ſhe had then almoſt all her ſtrength, which ſhe afterwards loſt with the reſt of her Blood, which all along flooded away; and deſirous to know whether they could have delivered her, I found, by trying her body, that the inward ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Womb was dilated in ſuch ſort that I could eaſily introduce two or three fingers, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving marked it, I made the Midwife try again to ſee whether the orifice was ſo diſpoſed when the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon ſaid that ſhe could not be delivered, and whether ſhe was of his opinion. She told me it was ſo, and that it had been alwayes in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the time of his departure. Aſſoon as ſhe had made me this declaration, I eaſily perceived his ignorance, and where the ſhoe wring'd him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I told her, that I woundred much they were both of that opinion, ſeeing that in truth it ſeemed quite contrary to me, becauſe it was at that time moſt certainly very eaſie for him to have
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:171433:67"/>
delivered her, if he had pleaſed, as it ſtil was, &amp; what indeed I would have done at that very moment, if it had been poſſible for me to have had power enough over my Spirit, which wavered a long while about the reſolution I was conſtrained to take, after I had loſt the hopes of all other help. That which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me, was not ſo much the Prognoſtick, that ſo famous a Chirurgeon had made, in perſwading all the Aſſiſtants, that ſhe could not be delivered, (though it might ſeem raſh to oppoſe the ſayings of ſuch as are eſteemed Oracles) neither was it the little ſtrength the Patient had then left: but it was chiefly the relation of the Perſon, being my Siſter, whom I tenderly loved, which troubled my ſpirits with ſuch different paſſions, to ſee her before me ready to expire through the prodigious loſs of blood, which proceeded from the ſame ſpring as mine own, that it was impoſſible for me at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reſolve, and obliged me to ſend again to the Chirurgeon (who was long ſince returned home) to entreat him to come back again to the Houſe, that (my ſelf demonſtrating to him the facility I found for the operation, and making him underſtand and confeſs that in thoſe caſes there is no hope, unleſs it be undertaken as ſoon as may be) I might perſwade him to deliver her, rather than to abandon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo to the diſpair of her life, as he had done, and to ſuffer the Infant to periſh with her unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; which had been prevented if he had done what Art required, which is at leaſt (when both cannot be ſaved) to ſave the Child, if poſſible, without prejudice to the Mother, which was very eaſie, as you ſhall preſently underſtand: But no prayers nor ſollicitations could ever prevail with him
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:171433:67"/>
to return, excuſing himſelf that it was impoſſible for him to do any thing in the caſe. When this was related to me, I ſent yet again to another Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, one of my Companions, being a little more obliging and ſerviceable, whom, if he had come time enough, I would have convinced of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the operation, and made him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the facility of it: but by misfortune he was abroad. During all theſe goings and comings, there was an hour and half ſpent, which time ſhe flooded without intermiſſion, and her weakneſs grew more and more: wherefore ſeeing my ſelf without hopes of getting the perſons I ſent for, I reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver her preſently, which before was beyond my power, for the reaſons recited, and indeed was now a little too late for the Mother; for, if I could have commanded my paſſions to have done it at the inſtant I arrived, there would then have been great bopes to have ſaved her, as well as I did the Child: After I had thus prepared my ſelf for it, that is, having directed two of my fingers into the inner orifice of the Womb, being open enough to admit them into it, I did in a little while after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a third, and by degrees the ends of all the five of my right hand, with which I dilated the orifice ſufficiently to admit it quite in, as it is very eaſie in the like caſes, becauſe the abundance of Blood moiſtens and relaxeth extreamly (as is already mentioned) the whole Womb, into which having ſo gently entred my hand, I found the Child came right, and the Waters not yet broken; wherefore I preſently broke the membranes with my nails and fingers, and then turning the Child, I took it by the feet, and brought it forth very eaſily, after the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:171433:68"/>
manner I ſhall teach in the forementioned 14th Chapter of the 2d Book, all which I finiſhed in leſs time than a hundred could be counted, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly proteſt never to have delivered a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſooner in all my life, of thoſe whoſe Children came againſt Nature, nor eaſier, and with leſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Mother, who did not in the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain during the Operation, although ſhe had her ſenſes very well, and exactly knew all I did to her, and found her ſelf very much comforted as ſoon as ever ſhe was delivered, and immediately after the flooding began to ceaſe: As to the Child I brought it alive, and it was preſently baptized by a Prieſt that was in the Chamber. The poor Patient, and all the company preſent (which were in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) found then manifeſtly that the Chirurgion and Midwife, who ſaid ſhe could not be delivered, had but little reaſon to aſſure any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>The Operation was finiſhed time enough for the Childs baptiſm, which (praiſed be God) it received; but too late to ſave the Mothers life, who (having before loſt all her Blood) dyed an hour after ſhe was ſo delivered, by the ſame weakneſs that ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fell into before ſhe was delivered. The flooding indeed ceaſed preſently, but ſhe had not Blood enough left to enable her to reſiſt thoſe frequent faintings, which ſhe might have done, as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be conjectured, if the Chirurgion that firſt ſaw her had delivered her three long hours before, as without doubt he might as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have done as I; in which time ſhe loſt above twenty<note n="*" place="margin">each Porenger contains about four ounces.</note> ſmall porengers of Blood, of which four or five poſſibly might have been
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:171433:68"/>
ſufficient to have ſaved her life, ſhe being a young Woman of a very good conſtitution, having no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience or ſickneſs when ſhe was ſurpriſed with this fatal accident, which befel her (as aforeſaid) about eleven in the morning, and ſhe was delivered about ſeven at night; and becauſe ſhe had loſt ſo much Blood before the Operation, it proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, ſhe dying an hour after, having her perfect ſenſes to the moment ſhe expired, which was about eight the ſame night.</p>
               <p>I will upon this lamentable Subject (to the end more care may be taken in the like caſes) examine by way of digreſſion, what might be the motive of this proceeding of the Chirurgeon, and of ſome others of the ſame humour. It muſt neceſſarily be agreed, that it was for one or more of theſe three cauſes, why either he would not, or could not lay this Woman when he ſaw her two hours before me, which (as I noted before) might eaſily have been done: It was either through Ignorance, Malice, or Policy: To imagine it his Ignorance, I cannot perſwade my ſelf, becauſe he hath too great Reputation for that, although many perſons that underſtand the Art ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, eaſily agree with me, that he is of the number of thoſe, of whom may juſtly be ſaid, <hi>Minuit praeſentia famam.</hi> That it was through Malice, who can imagine a man of ſo deteſtable a reſolution could be found! but if it were neither Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance nor Malice, it is eaſy to gueſs it a damnable Policy, qualified by ſome with the name of Prudence;<note n="*" place="margin">A good Warning not to rely too much upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſuch famous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners, or Midwives, that prefer their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions above their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</note> this falſe Prudence they
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:171433:69"/>
ordinarily uſe, that are in great reputation, ever endeavouring to their utmoſt to ſhun dangerous Cures, leſt they that underſtand not the Art, ſhould quit the good opinion they had of them, when it happens that the Patient dies under their hands, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were carefully and duly delivered. This was juſt our misfortune; for this Chiurgeon, who was very much eſteemed by many Women of quality whom he delivered, avoided, all he could, dangerous labours, ſubject to ill ſucceſs, as this was; and the rather then, becauſe there was in my Siſters Chamber a Lady of quality, Wife to one of the chief Captains of the Guards, who dwelt in the ſame houſe, and whom he ordinarily delivered; which was the cauſe, that, believing the iſſue of the Operation doubtful, he choſe rather to preſerve the eſteem of his ancient practice, amongſt ſuch as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the buſineſs well enough to be judge of his proceedings, than to do in this caſe his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty; to which one ought alwayes to have more regard, than to all theſe Intereſts of vain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, which uſually corrupts the Conſcience. They that make uſe of this Policy are often acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the death of poor Women who call for their aſſiſtance, and of their Children alſo.</p>
               <p>I was willing to recite every circumſtance of this Tragedy, that one may know in the like caſe the neceſſity of a ſpeedy delivery. I have ſince that had many in the ſame caſe, to whom (by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God) I warranted the lives of the Women, and ſaved the Children; of which I had in my ſelf more ſatisfaction, than I could have gained by all the honour the World could procure me by ſo wicked a policy; which neither Chirurgeon nor
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:171433:69"/>
Midwife of an upright Conſcience will ever uſe.</p>
               <p>Now ſince in all floodings, there ever follows weakneſs and faintings, we muſt endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that little ſtrength the Patient hath left, and augment it if poſſible; that ſo they may have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to endure the operation, and to eſcape after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: to which purpoſe there ought to be given her, from time to time, good ſtrengthening Broths, Gelly's, and a little good Wine: ſhe muſt alwayes ſmel to Roſe-vinegar, and have a warm toaſt dipt in Wine and Cinamon, applied to the region of her Heart; which will do her more good than ſolid food: for, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith in the eleventh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſm of his ſecond Book, <hi>Facilius eſt potu refici, quam cibo,</hi> one is ſooner nouriſhed by drink than meat; becauſe the liquid aliments are much ſooner diſtributed than the ſolid: And to prevent the Blood from flooding in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance till ſhe can be delivered,<note n="*" place="margin">Rather Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures above the elbows, becauſe too much Blood is already loſt.</note> a Vein in her Arm may be opened, to turn a little the courſe backwards; and apply all along her Reins, Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins wet in Water and Vinegar. But if the flooding proceds from the ſeparation of the after-burthen from the Womb, as my Siſters was, all theſe things are to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and the beſt expedient is to deliver the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man aſſoon as may be, though ſhe were but three or four months gone with Child, or leſs; becauſe all ought as well to be brought away, whatever is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Womb, whether it be Falſ-conception, Mole, or Child, without leaving any thing behind, which when it is quite cleared, cloſing and contracting it ſelf, ſtops the flooding, for the reaſons above alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:171433:70"/>
and all accidents which were cauſed by it; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Woman afterwards recovers, if there be but ſufficient ſtrength remaining after delivery, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will be, if not delayed too long.</p>

               <p>MAny Women with Child find an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary weight at the bottom of their Bellies; which comes, becauſe the Womb, by the weight it contains in its capacity, bears down upon the neck, and ſometimes ſo low that they cannot walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain and ſtradling; at which time alſo they cannot uſe copulation but with great inconvenience.</p>
               <p>The bearing down of the Womb, is when it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls into the <hi>Vagina,</hi> without coming in the leaſt without the Privities, for then it is called the falling-out, or <hi>Praecipitation;</hi> which is a more troubleſom and dangerous Diſeaſe, and doth not uſually befal Women with Child, becauſe the extent and bigneſs of the Womb hinders it, that it cannot fall out, but only bears down. The Precipitation is diſcerned by the view; and the bearing down eaſily, by puting up a Finger into the <hi>Vagina;</hi> for there the Womb will be ſoon met with, and its inner Orifice, which is very near the Privities, eſpecially when the Woman ſtands upright.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:171433:70"/>This bearing down, is often cauſed by the relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ligaments of the Womb, and chiefly the large ones, which ought to faſten it on each ſide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the loins, to prevent it; which relaxation comes either from the weight of the burthen it bears and contains within, which conſtrains theſe liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be extended more than ordinary; or from ſome fall, which by much ſhaking of it produceth the ſame effect, and ſo much the eaſier, by how much the burthen is greater; and likewiſe from ſome great pains or bad labour which preceeded the preſent pregnancy: or very often it is cauſed, or at leaſt facilitated by abundance of humours, which moiſtening the ligaments, relax them in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to which the phlegmatick are very ſubject, who uſually are much troubled with the Whites.</p>
               <p>Beſides the hinderance which the bearing down of the Womb cauſeth to the Womans walking and uſe of coition (as we have above mentioned) it cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth likewiſe by its weight, principally towards the latter end of her reckoning, a numneſs in her Hips, ſleepineſs in her Thighs, as alſo difficulty of Urine, and going to ſtool: becauſe by bearing down it preſſeth down the Bladder and the great Gut, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both which it is ſcituated. The Patient may be much eaſier cured of this bearing-down, after ſhe is brought to bed, than whilſt ſhe is with Child; for being freed from its burthen, its ligaments will be the eaſier fortified: beſides ſhe may then uſe peffaries to keep it in its place, which cannot ſo well be done when ſhe is with Child.</p>
               <p>From what cauſe ſoever this bearing-down pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, the beſt remedy for a big-bellied Woman is to keep her bed, becauſe the weight of it doth more
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:171433:71"/>
and more relax the ligaments when ſhe is up: And if ſhe have neither the means nor convenience ſo to take her reſt, at leaſt let her, if her belly be big enough, as it is towards the later end of her reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wear a Swaith very broad and fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that by this means the burthen being a little ſupported, the ligaments may not be ſo much ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and lengthened; and if ſhe have a difficulty in making water, let her when ſhe would do it, help her ſelf by lifting up with both hands her Belly before, which will be a great eaſe, and hinder the neck of the Bladder from being ſo much compreſſed: but if the humours cauſe this relaxation of the ligaments of the Womb, ſhe muſt keep her ſelf to a drying dyet, her food being rather roſted than boiled, and muſt refrain from copulation. The Woman muſt not be ſtraight laced, becauſe that alſo forceth down the Matrix: and above all, when ſhe is in labour, care muſt be taken that neither by means of the throwes, which ſtrongly force down the Womb, nor by the birth of the Child, nor the violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the burthen, ſhe gets a precipitation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a bearing down; which is ſoon done, as is ſeen often, when the method I teach in the 16th chapter of the ſecond Book (where I treat of this Labour) is not well obſerved.</p>

               <p>THere are many phlegmatick Women, who certainly believe themſelves with Child, void nothing but water, which was collected together in their Womb, and called the Dropſie of the Womb. It hath often happened that ſuch a Diſeaſe hath deceived the Midwives as well as the Patient, who having a long time hoped, and been made to hope for a Child, at length inſtead of it, finds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but clear waters; as it once did to that Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merchant (I mentioned in the 13th chapter of this firſt Book) who at the end of nine or ten months, of ſuch a falſe Belly, voided a quantity of theſe waters, which was all that was contained and incloſed in the Womb. <hi>Guillemeau</hi> in the firſt chapter of his firſt Book of Labours, makes mention of the like Hiſtory, of one named Madam <hi>du Peſcher,</hi> who voided a pailfull of it, certainly believing her ſelf to be with Child: And <hi>Fernelius</hi> in the 15th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his 6th Book of <hi>Pathologie,</hi> recites a caſe much more wonderful concerning theſe Dropſies. He tells us that he ſaw a Woman who at the times of her purgations caſt forth, by the neck of the Womb, ſo great a quantity of water, very hot and yellowiſh, that ſhe filled ſix or ſeven Baſins, and voided ſo much of it that her Belly grew quite flat, after which her Courſes came immediatly in order; and that the following months the like quantity was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:171433:72"/>
amaſſed, which afterwards came away as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that this Woman (which is moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) being cured of this indiſpoſition, became with Child, and was brought to bed of a living Child.</p>
               <p>Theſe Waters are either bred in the Womb, or brought thither from ſome other part, as in the dropſie of the Belly it paſſeth by tranſudation through the porous ſubſtance of the membranes of the Womb. They are bred in the Womb, when it is too cold, or too much debilitated by an ill and violent Labour preceeding; or, becauſe the filth, as Whites, or other ſuperfluities which it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to diſcharge it ſelf of, hath a long time been ſuppreſſed. When the Waters contained in the capacity of the Womb have been ſent thither from elſewhere, they are then never wrapt in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular membrane, but only retained by the exact cloſure of its Orifice, and flows away as ſoon as it begins to open: but when they are bred in the Womb (which is for the moſt part after copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if the Seed be either too cold, wateriſh, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted) they are then ſometimes contained within membranes, which hinders the Patient from a ſpeedy diſcharging of it, ſhe going with it as long almoſt as with a Child: and this is the Dropſie which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them ſometimes they are with Child.</p>
               <p>'Tis eaſie to avoid being deceived by taking the Dropſie of the Womb for a Child, if one takes but good notice of all the ſigns mentioned, in treating of a true Conception, which concur not in this diſeaſe. The Patient hath indeed her Belly ſwell'd, and her Courſes ſtopt in this caſe as well as if ſhe were with Child, but there are many things which will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us the difference; for in the Dropſie, her
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:171433:72"/>
Breaſts are flabby ſoft and fallen, ſhe will have no Milk in them, nor find her ſelf quicken at the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary time, but only as it were a bubbling of agitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Waters; ſhe will have a greater pain and weight in her Belly, which is likewiſe more equally in its circumference extended, than if there were a Child; ſhe will alſo have the Lips of the Womb, her Thighs and Legs ſwell'd &amp; aedematous; and a worſe colour in her Face, than when ſhe is with Child. Now as this Dropſie may come alone, ſo likewiſe may often happen together with a true Conception, theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being then contained without the membranes of the Child in the capacity of the Womb; for though there may be much Water within theſe membranes, it is not properly the Dropſie of the Womb, becauſe there muſt ever naturally be ſome, in the midſt of which the <hi>Faetus</hi> is contained: Notwithſtanding, ſometimes there is ſuch a quantity of them, which doth ſo prodigiouſly ſwell the Womans Belly, that one would believe ſhe had two or three Children, when ſhe hath but only one, which is much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by it, becauſe the greateſt part of its nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is reſolved into theſe Waters, which almoſt extinguiſheth and ſuffocates that little natural heat which is there. Some Women have evacuated three or four quarts above two months before they were brought to bed; when this happens, they are then contained in the Womb without the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes; for elſe the Child would be neceſſitated to be born preſently after theſe Evacuations,<note n="*" place="margin">That being the right time of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> if it were the Waters (that ought natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be contained in the membranes) that came away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:171433:73"/>The beſt Remedy for this kind of Dropſy, the Woman being vvith Child, is to vvait vvith patience the hour of her delivery, obſerving the mean time a drying dyet: but vvhen it is only Water contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Womb, ſhe muſt uſe Diureticks to cauſe the Womb to open to evacuate them; and her Courſes muſt be endeavoured to be provoked, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alwayes a care to deſtroy by convenient Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the cauſe of the generation of ſuch ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>The Womb is ſometimes ſo full of theſe humours, that it diſchargeth ſome on the outward parts, and principally upon thoſe vvhich are near, as the lips of the Privities, vvhich often are thereby ſo ſwelled, that they become quite blown up; and ſometimes in ſome Women are ſo big and ſwelled, that they cannot cloſe their Thighs together for them, vvhich hinders their vvalking, unleſs vvith pain and great inconvenience. This Swelling is then livid, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tranſparant, even as a <hi>Hydrocele;</hi> becauſe of the quantity of clear Water vvhich filled it: and becauſe it may be painful and inconvenient to the Woman during her labour, by reaſon they ſtraiten the paſſages, it vvill be neceſſary to remedy it before; vvhich, for the greater certainty, muſt be done by the operation of the hand, making many ſcarrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vvith a Lancet all along the lips, vvhereby the humours will ſweat out and diſtil forth by little and little; after vvhich Compreſſes dipt in Aromatick and Aſtringent Wine, muſt be put upon it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Relapſes, by fortifying the parts, cauſing the Patient to obſerve all the vvhile a good dyet fit for the Dropſie. Some vvould apply Leeches, to avoid the pain of the Lancet: but they are not ſo proper,

becauſe the ſmall orifices they make, aſſoon as they are taken off, immediately cloſe again, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not ſo ſoon to the Scarrifications, made as big or little as one will, and may be kept open by oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments applied to them, as long as may be thought fit or neceſſary.</p>

               <p>IT is not very hard to imagine, how a breeding-Woman, that hath the <hi>Pox,</hi> can communicate it to a Child in her belly, becauſe this contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe corrupting all the maſs of the Mothers blood, it is neceſſary the Infant, which hath then no other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance, ſhould be infected with it, converting this bad blood into its own ſubſtance, the acrimony of which Blood eaſily cauſeth in an Infants tender bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thoſe malignant ulcers, which all ſuch, whoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are contaminated with it, uſually bring with them at their birth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pox</hi> which in its eſſence is of the ſame ſpecies, and is only diſtinguiſhed by degrees according as it is greater or leſs, communicating it ſelf by the means of the Mothers blood, will make more or leſs impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the Infants body according to its ſtrength or weakneſs; and if the big-bellied Woman have Ulcers very near the Womb, as in the neck and neighbouring parts, by this proximity the venom will be very eaſily conveyed to it.</p>
               <p>I do not deſign here to enquire into the bottom
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:171433:74"/>
of this Venereal Diſeaſe, nor to write particularly of the cure of it: but intend only to ſhew vvhether the Woman may undergo the Cure vvhilſt with Child, or ought therefore to defer it till after they are brought to bed. That this may be the better determined, we muſt make ſome diſtinction; for, when the Woman is towards the end of her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it ought to be deferred till after ſhe is brought to bed, when both ſhe and the Child, if infected, may be taken in hand; becauſe the labour coming on, when the Woman is in the midſt of her Cure, ſhe may run the hazard of her life: and beſides, if the Child ſhould be then ſtill-born, one would be apt to think it was killed by the violence of the Medicaments, and blame the Chirurgeon of raſhneſs.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Pox</hi> is but in the firſt degree, and hath cauſed no great accidents, one ought then likewiſe to remit the eradicating Cure till after Childbed, and be contented only with the palliating by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient dyet and gentle purgers from time to time, to prevent the evils encreaſing: but if the Woman when young with Child, hath the <hi>Pox</hi> in the higheſt degree, accompanied with very great and continual accidents, which threaten danger, if her Cure be protracted till after Delivery; becauſe in ſo long a time theſe accidents augmenting more and more, it would be impoſſible but her Fruit ſhould be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and very hard if ſhe did not miſcarry: that the greateſt of theſe two evils be avoided, ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtrength enough, ought to be taken in hand; for, to imagine the worſt, that the Remedies make her miſcarry, it is no more than the greatneſs of the Diſeaſe would otherwiſe certainly do. Let her then
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:171433:74"/>
be taken in hand, without ſuffering the accidents longer to augment, vvhich by continuance render themſelves much more dangerous both to her and her Child, being careful to give her the gentleſt Remedies, and with more preparation and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, ſo that the Evacuation procured to her by Salivation, be rather by little at a time, and the longer, than too great and ſudden; and above all, that it be rather by anointing the upper parts only with<note n="*" place="margin">As Unguentum Neapolitanum.</note> Mercurial Oyntments, and not by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, which ſooner endanger miſcarrying, by opening the Womb; beſides, that they ſooner cauſe the Fruit to periſh if it had life. For the ſame reaſon alſo, no Mercurial Medicine muſt be taken in at the mouth: vvherefore fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the upper parts are to be preferred, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring alwayes, as much as may be, to be Maſters of the Evacuation, and to hinder it from cauſing a Looſneſs; for that is more dangerous than Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, becauſe of the continual forcing downward in going to ſtool, by which the Womb receives great commotion, and is extreamly agitated.</p>
               <p>I know very well that many will not eaſily be perſwaded, but that either it is impoſſible to cure a Woman of the <hi>Pox</hi> whilſt ſhe is with Child, or that ſhe and her Child cannot undergo the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies without inevitable danger of death: however, the experience I have had of it my ſelf, makes me to be of another opinion, which I am vvilling to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate for an example in the like caſe. In the Year 1660, when I practiſed Midwifery in the <hi>Hoſtel de Dieu</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> a young Wench, not above twenty years old, came thither to lie-in of her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:171433:75"/>
Child, that had had the <hi>Pox</hi> before ever ſhe conceived the firſt time, and after miſcarried of a dead Child, rotten with the <hi>Pox;</hi> therefore being big this ſecond time, and perceiving the accidents of ber diſeaſe to augment more and more, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded there was no hopes this great Belly would ſucceed any better than the firſt, becauſe ſhe had all over her Body, eſpecially upon both her Breaſts, very many malignant Ulcers, which encreaſed day by day, and fearing it might turn to a Cancer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Reckoning was compleat, being but three months gone, ſhe reſolved to ſubmit to a thorough-Cure then, and to hazard her life in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſave her Child's, having no other hopes to effect it, nor being able her ſelf to reſiſt the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſeaſe. She acquainted three or four Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons both vvith her diſeaſe and deſign, not at all concealing her great-belly; who for that cauſe would not undertake her, (although ſhe was fully reſolved upon it, and promiſed to pay them vvell) telling her that their Conſcience would not ſuffer them to do it in the condition ſhe was in, and that it would be better ſhe would patiently ſubmit to it aſwell as ſhe could till ſhe was brought to bed, and then they vvould very vvillingly undertake her: But when ſhe found none would undertake her, unleſs ſhe concealed her great-belly, vvhich was not hard to be done being but three months gone, and believing there was no better an expedient; She met with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other (to whom ſhe mentioned nothing of her great Belly) that put her into the ordinary courſe, as if there had been no Conception; and, beſides the common Remedies uſed in this diſeaſe, he gave her a Salivation by five or ſix reiterated Frictions of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:171433:75"/>
Oyntment, vvhich followed her very plentifully five vvhole vveeks, ſo that ſhe vvas vvell and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, without leaving the leaſt ill accident behind of her diſeaſe. When ſhe was almoſt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and that all had ſucceeded wel, ſhe told her Chirurgeon ſhe was four months &amp; a half gone with Child, (for ſhe was three months when ſhe came to him, where ſhe lodged ſix weeks intire, without having it in the leaſt perceived) which at firſt he could hardly believe, but perceiving her Belly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grown bigger than leſſer during the Evacuation the Phyſick had made, he was immediately aſſured of the truth of it: She informed him that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſhe had concealed her great-Belly, was, the refuſal four Chirurgions (to whom ſhe had confeſt it) made to take her in hand. From the time ſhe was cured ſhe ſuffered not the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience during all the remainder of her time, except a little want, becauſe all the money ſhe had was given the Chirurgeon for her Cure, which made her come to the <hi>Hoſtel de Dieu</hi> to lie-in, where I delivered her of a Child at the full time, as big, fat and healthy, as if the Mother never had had the leaſt touch of that diſeaſe in her whole body; and which was very remarkable, the Burthen (which is a part very ſuſceptable of the leaſt impreſſion of a Woman's corrupt humours) was as neat, fair and ruddy as could be imagined.</p>
               <p>This example, which is very true, may convince us, that a big-bellied Woman may be taken in hand for the <hi>Pox;</hi> and more ſafely, if the Precautions noted above be carefully obſerved: For it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction, that if this Woman had not been cured, ſhe had this ſecond time been brought to bed
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:171433:76"/>
of a rotten Child, as before. Relating once this Hiſtory to a Chirurgion, a Friend of mine; he told me, that himſelf twice, in two different perſons, had the ſame ſucceſs, who were very well cured, and their Children likewiſe well born at the full time, without having the leaſt impreſſion of the venom in any part of their Body. <hi>Varandaeus</hi> confirms to us this truth in the ſecond Chapter of his ſecond Book of Womens Diſeaſes, where he preciſely tells us, that he had ſeen big-bellied Women who had had this diſeaſe eradicated by anointings with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> and Salivation preſcribed by Empericks; which may convince us that this Cure will eaſily have a better ſucceſs, when governed and managed by a knowing and methodical perſon.</p>
               <p>In a word, 'tis eaſie to be perſwaded that they can endure it, although with Child, becauſe many very often have continual Feavers for twelve or fifteen dayes, and other acute diſtempers, for which they have been neceſſited to be nine or<note n="*" place="margin">Such frequent bleeding Women with Child in ſo ſhort a ſpace, is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in England.</note> ten times blooded, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding have oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gone through with their Children to their full account, and been delivered of them as well as if they never had had any ill accident.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Of Abortion, and its Cauſes.</head>
               <p>WHen a Woman caſts forth in the beginning what ſhe had retained by conception in the Womb, 'tis called an Effluxion, or a ſliding away of the Seeds, becauſe they have not yet acquired any ſolid ſubſtance; if they miſcarry of a falſe-concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is ordinarily from the later end of the firſt to the end of the ſecond month, it is called an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion; but when the Infant is already formed, and begins to live, if it comes before the time or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and preſcribed by Nature, it is an abortion: which may happen from the ſecond to the beginning of the ſeventh month, for afterwards it is accounted a Birth, becauſe the Infant being ſtrong enough, and having all its perfections, may then live, which is impoſſible, if he comes before. Theſe things thus underſtood, we then ſay, that an Abortion is an iſſuing forth of the Child, yet imperfect, out of the Womb contrary to Nature, before the term limited; which is the cauſe, that for the moſt part it is dead, or if ſometimes alive, it dies in a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>We may in general aſſert, that every acute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe eaſily makes a Woman miſcarry; becauſe they deſtroy her fruit, which being dead, never ſtayes long in the Womb; and alſo puts the Woman in great hazard of her life, as ſaith <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the 30th Aphoriſm of his 5th Book, <hi>Mulierem gravidam morbo quopiam acuto corripi, lethale.</hi> The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:171433:77"/>
cauſes of Abortion, are all the accidents mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preceding chapters; as violent and frequent vomitings; becauſe there is not only want of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient nouriſhment for Mother and Child, when the food is ſo continually vomited up, but alſo great reachings and endeavours, by which the Womb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often compreſſed, and as it were ſhaken, is at laſt conſtrained to diſcharge it ſelf before its time. Pains of the Reins, great Cholicks and Gripes may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cauſe the ſame accident, as the Strangury alſo; for there are then made ſtrong compreſſions of the Belly every moment to expel the Urine. Great Coughs by their frequent agitation, ſuddenly thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> with force downwards, give alſo violent ſhocks to the Womb. Great Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes endanger a Woman to miſcarry, according to the 34th Aphoriſm of the 5th Book; and ſooner if a <hi>Teneſmus</hi> follows, which is great needings, whereby the right Gut ſeeks to expel the ſharp hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that irritate and provoke it. This makes us take notice of the 27th of the 7th Book, <hi>Mulieri utero gerenti, ſi tenſio ſupervenerit, facit abortum:</hi> for in this caſe the Womb, which is ſcituated upon the <hi>Rectum,</hi> receives a great commotion by its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual needings. If a Womans Courſes flow immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly, it is impoſſible her Fruit can be in health, as it is in the 60th Aphoriſm of the 5th Book; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the Infant is not ſufficiently nouriſhed, the Womb alſo by being too much moiſtened, is eaſily relaxed and opened. Letting Blood immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately doth the ſame for the ſame reaſon, eſpecially if the Child be great, according to the 31th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame Book.</p>
               <p>But one of the worſt accidents which cauſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortion,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:171433:77"/>
is that Flooding, which proceeds from the ſeparation of the After-birth from the Womb, of which we treated in the 20th Chapter of this firſt Book.</p>
               <p>The Dropſie of the Womb hinders the Child from growing to perfection, for the great abundance of Water extinguiſheth the natural heat which is already at that time much debilitated; and the Pox in the Mother infects the Child, and often Kills it in her Belly, as we have demonſtrated in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Chapter; and whatever very much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates and ſhakes the big-bellied Womans body, is capable of making her miſcarry; as great labour, ſtrong contorſions, or violent motions, of what manner ſoever, in falling, leaping, dancing, and running or riding, going in a Coach or Waggon, crying aloud, or laughing heartily, or any blow received on the Belly; becauſe that by ſuch agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and commotions, the ligaments of the Womb are relaxed, yea and ſometimes broken, as alſo the After-birth and Membranes of the <hi>Faetus</hi> are looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. A great noiſe ſuddenly and unexpectedly heard may make ſome Women miſcarry; as the noiſe of a Cannon, and chiefly Thunderclaps; and yet more eaſily, if to this noiſe be added the fear they uſually have of ſuch things, which happens ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the young than elderly Women; becauſe their bodies being more tender and tranſpirable, the air, which is ſtrongly forced by that noiſe, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into all her pores, offers a great violence by its impulſion on the Womb, and on the Child within it; which the elder being more robuſt, thicker and cloſer, reſiſt with more eaſe. Great watchings, cauſing a diſſipation of the Womans
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:171433:78"/>
ſtrength, and much faſting for want of food, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Infant from acquiring its perfection; fetid and ſtinking ſmells do much contribute to abortion, and amongſt others the ſmell of Charcoal, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Hiſtory recited in the 10th Chapter of this Book.</p>
               <p>The indiſpoſitions of the Womb produce the ſame effect, as when it is callous, or ſo ſmall, or ſo much compreſſed by the <hi>Epiploon,</hi> that it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as it ought to be, ſufficient to contain the Child and Burthen with eaſe together, with the Waters, which may likewiſe happen, if the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be too ſtrait laced, or keeps in her Belly with ſtrong and ſtiff Busks for to be well ſhap'd; or by this ſubtilty to conceal a great-belly, as ſome do; frequent copulation, eſpecially towards the end of her reckoning, may effect the ſame thing, becauſe then, the Womb being very full, bears much down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and its inward orifice being very near, is ſubjected to violence.</p>
               <p>If a Woman miſcarries, without any of theſe accidents, and that one deſires to know the cauſe of it, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> explains it in his 46th Aphoriſm of the 5th Book, where he ſaith, <hi>Quae veró medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criter corpulentae abortum faciunt ſecundo menſe, aut tertio, fine occaſione manifeſta, iis acetabula uteri mucoris ſunt plena, nec prae pondere faetum continere poſſunt ſed abrumpuntur:</hi> any Woman indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corpulent, that miſcarries the ſecond or third month, without manifeſt or apparent cauſe, it is, becauſe the Cotyl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dons of the Womb (which are the inward cloſures of its veſſels) are full of viſcous filth, by reaſon of which they cannot retain the weight of the <hi>Faetus,</hi> which is looſened from it. To
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:171433:78"/>
this accident phlegmatick Women are very ſubject, and thoſe who have the Whites exceedingly, which by their continual affluence, moiſten, and make the Womb within ſo ſlippery that the After-burthen cannot adhere to it, which alſo relaxeth it and its inward orifice, that the leaſt occaſion cauſeth abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But if the paſſions of the body cauſe ſo much hurt to a big-bellied Woman, thoſe of the mind do no Ieſs, and ſpecially Choler, which agitates, inflames, diſperſes and troubles all the Spirits, and maſs of Blood, by which the Child ſuffers extreamly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the tenderneſs of its body; but above all, ſudden fear, and the relation of bad news, are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to make the Women miſcarry at that inſtant; (as it happened to the Mother of that Couſin of mine, whom I mentioned in the 10th Chapter of this firſt Book) which likewiſe the other paſſions may cauſe, according as they are more or leſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but not ſo eaſily. There are yet other cauſes of miſcarrying which may be ſaid to proceed from the Infant, as when they are monſtrous, becauſe they do not then follow the rule of Nature; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when they have an unnatural ſcituation, which makes them torment themſelves becauſe of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity, and they oblige the Womb to expel them, not being able to endure the pains they cauſe, which it yet does, when it is ſo great that it cannot contain it to the full time, nor the Mother furniſh it with ſufficient nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>If we find one or more of the above ſpecified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and that the Woman withall hath a great heavineſs in her Belly, ſo that it falls like a ball on her ſide when ſhe turns, and that there proceeds
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:171433:79"/>
out of her Womb ſtinking and cadaverous humors, it is a ſign ſhe will ſoon miſcarry of a dead Child: moreover, her Breaſts will confirm it, if having been hard and full in the beginning, they become after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards empty and flabby, as is ſpecified in the 37th Aphoriſm of the 5th Book; and the 38th of the ſame Book, ſaith, <hi>That if one of a big-bellied Womans Breaſts, who hath two Children, begins to flag, it is a ſign ſhe will miſcarry of the Child of that ſide; and of both, if both flag in the ſame manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is moſt certain, a Woman is in more danger of her life when ſhe miſcarries, than at her full time; becauſe (as we have ſaid before) abortion is wholly contrary to Nature, and very often accompanied with flooding: and in more danger of miſcarrying alwayes, if ſhe miſcarries of the firſt; and ſome apprehend then an impoſſibility of ever having Children after, to which, young married people are very ſubject, becauſe of the violent emotion and perturbation of the whole body, excited by ardent and frequent copulations: but notwithſtanding, they may preſerve their fruit, when their greater vigour is over, and their loves a little mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               <p>We have taught in each of the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, how to prevent all the accidents before reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, any of which is ſufficient to make her miſcarry; and the eaſier, if many are complicated: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to avoid a troubleſome and needleſs repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you may have recourſe to the Remedies there taught, by which both Women and Children may eſcape the danger of death.</p>
               <p>They that are ſubject to abortion, ought above all to take their eaſe, and keep in bed if they can,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:171433:79"/>
obſerving a good diet, and refraining copulation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as ſhe believes her ſelf to be with Child; avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uſe of all Diureticks and Aperitives, which are very pernicious; as alſo violent paſſions of the mind, becauſe they are very prejudicial. She ought likewiſe to be looſe in her dreſs, that ſhe may breath the freer, and not ſtrait laced, and rackt, as moſt of them are ordinarily with their Busks under their cloths, to make their bodies ſtrait; and amongſt other things, they had need take heed of ſlipping and falling in their walking, to which big-bellied Women are very ſubject, becauſe the bigneſs of their Bellies hinders them from ſeeing their way: they will therefore do well to wear low-heeld ſhoos with large ſoals, to prevent hurting themſelves, as too many daily do. I admire in this caſe the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many Midwives, and ſome Authors, who order a Woman with Child, to take, aſſoon as ſhe hath hurt her Belly with a fall, ſome Crimſon Silk, ſmall minced in the yolk of an Egg, or the grains of<note n="*" place="margin">Kermes.</note> Scarlet, and treddles of ſeveral Eggs put into the yolk of one; as if that entring the ſtomach, were able to fortifie the Womb and the Child in it, and to keep it there, for which there is no appearance of reaſon or truth: but quiet reſt indeed contributes much to it, which for this reaſon is uſually directed for nine dayes; although ſuch a one hath need of 15 dayes, or more, for her hurt or commotion; and to others, five or ſix is ſufficient; during which time may be applied hot to the Belly, Compreſſes ſteeped in Aromatick and Aſtringent Wine. But becauſe there are many Women ſo infatuated with this ſuperſtitious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, that they would not believe themſelves out
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:171433:80"/>
of danger, if they took not that Crimſon Silk, or the Treddles of the Eggs (which is a pure conceit) one may give it to thoſe that deſire it to content them, becauſe theſe Remedies, though uſeleſs, can yet do no hurt. It is now time to make an end of this firſt Book, in which I have only mentioned the moſt ordinary diſtempers, which have ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar indications in their cure, during the Womans being with Child; of which I have not treated very exactly, becauſe it may be ſuppoſed that one may elſewhere have a more perfect knowledge of them, with all their circumſtances: let us now paſs to the ſecond Book, to treat of Deliveries, not only the natural, but likewiſe all that are contrary to nature, it being the principal motive that induced me to write, and to teach as well as I can, the beſt and moſt methodical deportment in it.</p>

               <p>BY a Delivery we underſtand either an emiſſion or extraction of the Infant, at the full time, out of the Womb. This definition may, comprehend as well the Natural, which is accompliſhed by emiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Infant coming in a commodious and natural Figure, the Womb ſends it forth without extraordinary violence: as the delivery contrary to Nature, which we are often obliged to perform, extracting it by manual operation.</p>
               <p>Every time the Womb lets paſs, or ſends forth, whatſoever it had retained and formed after concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt not be call'd a labour; for, obſerving what I have already noted above, and what I will here again repeat, that it may be more plain, If a Woman voids by the Womb what is contained in the beginning after ſhe had conceived, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called an effluxion or ſlip: becauſe at that time, there is nothing formed or figured, neither have the Seeds yet any firm conſiſtence, which is the cauſe why it flips away ſo eaſily with the leaſt opening of the Womb, as often happens between the firſt conceiving and the ſeventh and eight day only; after which, until the end of the ſecond month, the Woman ſomtimes lets ſlip falſe-conceptions, which turn to Moles, if they continue any longer in the Womb; which is then called an Expulſion: And if after the third month or thereabouts, the time

when the <hi>Faetus</hi> is wholly formed and animated, it is ſent forth before the ſeventh, in that caſe it is an Abortion, which is alwayes the cauſe, either that the Infant comes dead into the World, or dies ſoon after. But we properly call Labour, or Delivery, every iſſuing forth of an Infant which happens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the end of the ſeventh month to all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the time afterwards; becauſe there is then a ſufficient perfection, as alſo ſtrength enough, to come into the World, and live in it afterwards.</p>
               <p>As to the general differences of Labour, we muſt take notice, that the one is legitimate or natural, the other illegitimate or againſt nature. To come to the knowledge of each, we ſay, that four condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt abſolutly be found in a Delivery that it may deſerve to be called legitimate or natural: firſt, that it be at full time; ſecondly, that it be ſpeedy, without any conſiderable accident; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Child be living; and fourthly, that he comes right in a good poſture or ſcituation: for if any of theſe four are wanting, the delivery is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature; and the more, by how much there are more of them wanting.</p>
               <p>As to the due time of Labour, moſt Authors aſſert that Nature hath appointed to all other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals a certain limited time of going with young, and bringing them forth: but that Women only, by a particular favour of the ſame nature, have none prefixt, neither for conceiving, going with Child, nor bringing forth. And as to conception, 'tis moſt certain, that a Woman can conceive at any time night or day, ſummer or winter, or any other ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever; becauſe ſhe can copulate when ſhe pleaſeth, which few other Animals can, who cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:171433:82"/>
but at certain ſeaſons when they become luſtful but as to the time they are accuſtomed to go with young, it is no more preciſely determined to them, than to a Woman; for as ſhe may be brought to bed either in the ſeventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, yea and ſometimes the eleventh month (which happens very rarely) but for the moſt part in the ninth month. So likewiſe for example, though the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary time for a Bitch to puppy is the fourth month or thereabouts, ſo ſome puppy ſooner and ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and Sheep which yean their Lambs at the end of five months, advance or recede from that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry term, according to the ground where they ſeed, and the quallity of their paſture, to which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes many particular diſpoſitions of each of theſe Animals; which likewiſe happens to all others, as well as to Women. We may perceive the ſame alſo in Fruit, for the ſeaſons and different Climats al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more or leſs aſſiſt their ſpeedy maturity, which depends likewiſe very much on good Husbandry. The firſt time that a Child may live, when born, is the ſeventh month compleat, and it may better from that till the end of the ninth month, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as that time is paſſ'd, the ſtay it makes after in the Womb, is no wayes beneficial to it, becauſe it hath then acquired all neceſſary perfection and ſtrength ſufficient to reſiſt all outward injuries. The Child born before the ſeventh month cannot live long, as we ſaid before, becauſe of its weakneſs: but he that is born in the eighth month may very well live, yea, and more likely than born in the 7th month (which is contrary to the opinion of all the world); becauſe it is more perfect, as I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate afterwards in the fifth Chapter of this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:171433:82"/>
ſecond Book, where I will particularly ſhew the cauſe of this error.</p>
               <p>Now as we ſometimes ſee Children born two months before the ordinary time of nine months, do live notwithſtanding; ſo there are ſome Women not brought to bed till towards the 10th month, and ſometimes not till the beginning of the 11th: although this may happen in ſome, yet there are many who deceive themſelves in their reckoning, believing that they are gone but ſeven or eight months, and ſometimes ten or more, when they are but juſt nine; that which thus abuſeth them, is their imagining themſelves with Child preciſely from the ſuppreſſing of their Courſes, though it be not alwayes true; becauſe ſome have wanted their Courſes two months before they became with Child; and others have them, on the contrary, two or three months after, on the uſual manner: which daily happens according to their different conſtitutions and temperaments, more or leſs Sanguine.</p>
               <p>If (as we have ſaid) the intire and perfect term be neceſſary to the legitimate and natural birth; a good figure and ſcituation of the Child is no leſs, which ought to come with the head firſt, in a ſtrait line, having the face turned downwards, that is, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Mothers back, the arms couched along its ſides, and the thighs ſtretcht upwards. This fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is much the better and convenient, becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the head (which is the biggeſt part of the Child) is paſſed, all the reſt coms forth eaſily, and that being ſo, none of the joynts of its body can be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hinder its paſſage forth: but any other part that may firſt preſent to the Labour, makes it unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and againſt Nature, in which caſe there is
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:171433:83"/>
often great danger to Mother or Child, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to both, if not ſuddenly and duely ſuccour'd.</p>
               <p>They who have no perfect knowledge of the parts of a Womans body, aqcuired by Anatomy, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to admire, and cannot (as they ſay) conceive how it is poſſible, that an Infant ſo big, can paſs in time of Labour through an opening of the Womb ſo ſmall; at which <hi>Galen,</hi> and many other Authors, have much admired; many of whom are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Womans <hi>os pubis</hi> is ſeparated to inlarge the paſſage at that time, without which it would be impoſſible for the Infant to have room enough to be born; and therefore Women a little antiquated, ſuffer more in their firſt Labours than others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their <hi>os pubis</hi> cannot be ſo eaſily ſeparated, which often kills their Children in the paſſage. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of the opinion that it is the <hi>Os ilium</hi> which is disjoynted from the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and ſay, both the one and the other of them, that theſe bones thus ſeparated at the hour of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, are thereto by degrees a little before diſpoſed by the ſlimy humours, which flow forth from about the Womb, and then mollifie the cartilage, which at other times joyn them firmly. But theſe two opinions are as far from Truth as Reaſon; for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy convinceth us clearly, that the Womb by no means toucheth theſe places, whereby to mollifie them by its humours; as alſo, that theſe bones are ſo joyned by the cartilage, that it is very difficult to ſeparate them with a Knife, eſpecially the <hi>ilium</hi> from the <hi>ſacrum,</hi> and almoſt impoſſible in ſome elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Women, without great violence, although <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe Paré</hi> (citing many witneſſes then preſent at the thing) reports the Hiſtory of a Woman, in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:171433:83"/>
whom (having been hanged fourteen dayes after ſhe was brought to bed) he found (as he ſaith) the <hi>os pubis</hi> ſeparated in the middle the breadth of half a finger, and the <hi>oſſa illia</hi> themſelves disjoynted from the <hi>os ſacrum.</hi> I will not in this caſe accuſe him of impoſture, for I have too much reſpect for him, and eſteem him too ſincere for it; but I indeed believe that he was miſtaken in this ſeparation; for there is no likelihood that being ſo at the time of her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, it would remain ſo a fourtnight after the breadth of half a finger; for then they ſhould have been obliged to carry this Woman to Execution: for ſhe would not have been able to have ſupported her ſelf to climb the Ladder of the Gibbet, and to keep her ſelf on her legs, according to the cuſtom of other Malefactors; becauſe the Body is only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the ſtability of theſe Bones: wherefore we muſt rather believe, as moſt probable, that ſuch a disjunction and ſeparation was cauſed either by the falling of this Womans Corps from the high Gibbet to the ground after execution; or rather by ſome impetuous blow on that place, received from ſome hard or ſolid thing. If we examine well the different figure and ſtructure of theſe Bones between a Man and a Womans Sceleton, we ſhall find a larger empty ſpace and diſtance between theſe Bones, much more conſiderable in Women than Men, and that to this purpoſe the leaſt Women hath the Bones of the <hi>Iſchion</hi> more diſtant the one from the other, than the biggeſt Man: they have all likewiſe the <hi>os ſacrum</hi> more outwards, and the <hi>pubis</hi> flatter, which makes the paſſage from this capacity, larger, and more able to give iſſue to the Child at the time of Labour; they have beſides this, the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:171433:84"/>
Bones <hi>illia</hi> much more turned outward, that the Womb being impregnated, may have more room to be extended on the ſides, and be more at eaſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſuch a diſpoſition as is here repreſented.</p>

               <p>Moreover, having often ſeen and diſſected Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men dead a few dayes after delivered, I found it very difficult to ſeparate theſe bones with a ſtrong ſharp Penknife, where I could never find the leaſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any preceding ſeparation: And if the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in years have more pain with the firſt Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than younger Women, it doth not proceed from the difficulty of the ſeparation of theſe bones (which never is for the reaſons above) but becauſe the membranes of their Womb are dry, hard, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:171433:86"/>
callous; and particularly its internal orifice, which therefore cannot ſo eaſily be dilated as young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, being more moiſt.</p>
               <p>Having ſufficiently explained what is Delivery, and all its differences, we muſt now examine what ſigns uſually precede, and what accompany a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Delivery, and an unnatural, which ſhall be the ſubject of the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>WHen Women with Child, chiefly of their firſt, perceive any extraordinary pains in their Belly, they immediately ſend for their Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, taking it for their Labour; who when ſhe is come, ought to be well informed of the matter, and careful not to put her in Labour before there is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to it; for many times both Mother and Child loſe their lives, when it is excited before the due time. Thoſe pains which may be called falſe, are uſually cauſed by a Cholick proceeding from Wind, which come and go, griping the whole Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any forcing downwards or into the Womb, as thoſe do which proceed or accompany Labour; and this Cholick is diſſipated by warm clothes applied to the Belly, and a Clyſter or two, by which true Labour-pains are rather furthered than hindered. A Woman may feel other kind of pains coming from an emotion cauſed by the Flux of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:171433:86"/>
the Belly, which are eaſily known by the frequent ſtools that follow.</p>
               <p>The ſigns preceding a natural Labour few dayes before, are, that the Belly which before lay high, ſinks down, &amp; hinders a Woman at that time from walking as eaſie as ſhe uſed; and there flows from the Womb ſlimy humours, appointed by nature to moiſten and ſmooth the paſſage, that its inward orifice may the more eaſily be dilated when it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; which beginning to open a little at that time, ſuffers that ſlime to flow away, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the humours that ſtrain through the thin ſubſtance of the Infants membranes, and acquires a viſcous conſiſtence by the heat of the place.</p>
               <p>The ſigns accompanying preſent Labour, <hi>(that is, ſhewing, that the Woman is effectively in Labour)</hi> are, great pains about the region of the Reins and Loins, which coming and redoubling by intervals, anſwers in the bottom of the Belly with reiterated throws: The face red and inflamed, becauſe the Blood is much heated by the continual endeavours a Woman makes to bring forth her Child; as alſo, becauſe that during theſe ſtrong throws her reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is ever intercepted, for which reaſon much Blood hath recourſe to the Face: Her privy parts are ſwell'd, becauſe the Infants Head (lying in the Birth) often thruſts and cauſeth the neighbouring parts to diſtend outwards, which thence appear ſwelled in this manner: She is often ſubject to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, which makes many believe, who know not the cauſe of it, that the Women to whom it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, are in danger: but on the contrary it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily a ſigne of ſpeedy delivery, becauſe the good pains are then excited and redoubled every
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:171433:87"/>
moment until the buſineſs be finiſhed. This Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting comes from a ſympathy, between the Womb and Stomach by reaſon of the ramifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the nerves of the ſixth pair of the Brain, which are diſtributed to both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by which it communicates the pain it feels at that time, ariſing from the agitation the violent and frequent motions of the Child cauſeth, and the ſtrong compreſſion the muſcles of the lower Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes during the throws, for to help the iſſue of the Child: beſides, when the birth is very near, Women are troubled with an univerſal trembling, and principally of the Legs and Thighs; not with cold, as at the beginning of an Ague-fit, but with the heat of the whole body, and the humours, which then flow from the Womb, are often diſcoloured with Blood, which with the ſigns above mentioned, is an infallible mark of the nearneſs of the birth, 'tis that the Midwives uſually call <hi>Shows;</hi> and if one then puts up their finger into the neck of the Womb, they will find the inner Orifice dilated, at the opening of which the membranes of the Infant, containing the Waters, preſent themſelves, and are ſtrongly forced downwards with every pain the Woman hath; at which time one may perceive them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and appear to the finger, ſo much the more or leſs hard and extended as the pains are ſtronger or weaker. Theſe membranes with the waters in them, when gathered (that is, when they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced before the head of the Child, which makes the Midwives call it the gathering of the waters) preſenting themſelves at this inward Orifice, do then reſemble very well to the touch of the finger, the abortive Eggs which have yet no ſhell, but are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:171433:87"/>
only covered with a ſimple membrane: after this the pains redoubling continually, the membranes are broken by the ſtrong impulſion of the waters, which incontinently flow away, and then the head of the Child is eaſily felt naked, and preſented at opening of the inward Orifice of the Womb: Now, all theſe, or the greateſt part of them met together, at what time ſoever of a Womans going with Child it be, whether full time or no, one may be aſſured ſhe will ſoon be delivered; but great care muſt be taken not to haſten her Labour, before the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it be known by theſe ſigns, for that would but torment the Woman and Child in vain, and put them both in danger of their lives, as that Midwife did, whom I found endeavouring to put the above named <hi>Martha Rolet</hi> in Labour at ſix months end, becauſe of ſome pains ſhe had in her Belly and Reins, without any other accident anſwering them downwards; which Hiſtory is at large in the ſixth Chapter of the firſt Book, to ſhew that in ſome caſes we muſt make no more haſte than good ſpeed.</p>
               <p>Labour contrary to Nature is when the Child comes in an ill Figure and ſcituation; as when it preſents any otherwiſe than the Head firſt, as alſo when the Waters flow away along time before it is born, becauſe it remains dry in the Womb, and they are abſolutely neceſſary to moiſten the paſſage, and render it more ſlippery. When the After burthen comes firſt, it is an accident which renders the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour always dangerous, by reaſon of the great flux of Blood uſually following, of which the Mother may die in a few hours, and the Infant (becauſe it receives no more nouriſhment) is quickly ſmotherd in the Womb, for want of reſpiration, which it then

needs, if it ſtay never ſo little after. The Labour is alſo grievous, when accompanied with a Feaver, or any other conſiderable Diſtemper, which may deſtroy the Child in the Womb, as alſo when pains are ſmall, and come ſlow with long intervals, and little profit, by reaſon of which a Woman is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly tyred: but the difficulty moſt frequent and ordinary comes from the Infant's wrong poſture. We ſhall ſpeak more particularly of the ſigns of all theſe different Deliveries, in treating of them ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hereafter: and now come to the inquiry of ſome particulars, without which it is impoſſible to aſſiſt a Woman ſafely in her natural Labour, or to help her in the unnatural ones: and therefore we will examine every thing that is in the Womb with the Infant during pregnancy, and firſt deſcribe thoſe that firſt offer themſelves to paſs the Orifice, when the Woman is neer her delivery, which are the membranes of the Infant, and the waters contained in them.</p>

Moſt Authors are ſo dark in the deſcriptions they make of theſe Membranes, that it is very hard to conceive them as they are, by the explication they make of them. They do not ſo much as agree in the number of them, ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count three as well for a Child as a Beaſt, to wit,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:171433:91"/>
the <hi>Chorion,</hi> the <hi>Amnios,</hi> and the <hi>Allantoides;</hi> others account but two, becauſe there is no <hi>Allantoides</hi> in a humane <hi>Faetus;</hi> but to ſpeak properly (if it be ſtrictly examined) what there is, (as I have often done) there will be never found but two, which are ſo joyned and contiguous the one to the other, that it may be ſaid to be but a double one, which may indeed be ſeparated and divided into two. I will explain it on ſuch wiſe, as may be beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by thoſe that are ignorant of it: for there are many, who think with <hi>Galen,</hi> that theſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes are ſeparated and diſtant the one from the other, and that the one ſurrounds only the Infant, and the other receives the Waters, which are partly engendred from ſweat, and partly from the urine, (as they imagine); and believe further, that theſe Waters themſelves are ſeparated the one from the other by theſe Membranes, which is quite contrary: for they are both ſo joyned the one to the other, that they compoſe as it were but the ſame body and involver, which ſerves (as we have already ſaid) to contain the Infant with the Waters, which are all of a nature, and ſhut up in the ſame Membranes, as I ſhall make appear hereafter in ſpeaking of their original): it matters not to the truth, after what manner this be explained, provided it may be underſtood as it is.</p>

The <hi>Chorion</hi> is a little rough, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal throughout the whole outſide of it, in which many ſmall capillary veſſels may be obſerved, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning quite round, as alſo many little fibres by which it cleaves to every ſide of the Womb: but it is a little more ſmooth within, where it joyns every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and unites with the <hi>Amnios,</hi> in ſuch a manner as that it appears (as we have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) but as one and the ſame Membrane. This <hi>Chorion</hi> covers the <hi>Placenta,</hi> and cleaves cloſe to the forepart of it, which reſpects the Infant, by means of the interlacings of an infinity of Veſſels: it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo principally faſtened to the Womb by the whole circumference of the <hi>Placenta,</hi> in which part this Membrane is a little thicker.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Amnios,</hi> which is the ſecond Membrane, is three times thiner than the <hi>Chorion:</hi> and is very ſmooth within, but not juſt ſo much where 'tis joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and united to the <hi>Chorion.</hi> This Membrane is ſo thin, that it is quite tranſparent; and hath no veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in it, which makes it ſo thin, as cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined without ſeeing. This <hi>Amnios</hi> doth in no wiſe touch the <hi>Placenta,</hi> though it covers it, but it lines only all the inner part of the <hi>Chorion,</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, and from which it may be wholly ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if it be done with care.</p>
               <p>The better to conceive this as it is, and after what manner theſe Membranes are in the Womb, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:171433:92"/>
the compoſition of a Foot-bal, imagining the Leather which covers it, to be the Womb of a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Woman, and the Bladder blown up with wind, within the Foot-ball, to be this double Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios,</hi> in which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained together the Child and the Waters; and even as the outſide of this Bladder toucheth every where (becauſe it is blown up) the Leather of the Foot-bal: ſo likewiſe the Membranes of the <hi>Faetus</hi> are joyned on all ſides to the Womb, except where the Burthen cleaves to it, in which place it paſſeth above it.</p>
               <p>As to the 3d (or rather pretended) Membrane, which Authors name <hi>Allantoide,</hi> &amp; ſay is like a Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage or Girdle, which ſurrounds &amp; clothes the Infant from the cartilage <hi>X<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sometimes Infants at their birth, bring forth theſe Membranes upon their head, and then 'tis ſaid they will be fortunate: which is meerly ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, becauſe it happens by the ſtrength of their ſubſtance, ſo that they cannot burſt by the impulſe of the Waters, or the Womens throws in Labour; or becauſe the paſſages being very large, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant very little, it paſſeth very eaſie without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: in truth in this reſpect they may be ſaid to be fortunate, for having been born ſo eaſily; and the Mother alſo for being ſo ſpeedily delivered; for in difficult Labours, Children are never born with ſuch caps, becauſe being tormented and preſſed in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:171433:92"/>
the paſſage, theſe Membranes are broken and remain ſtill there.</p>
               <p>Within the Infants Membranes (diſpoſed as I have explicated) are contained the Waters, in the midſt whereof he ſwims, and is ſcituated; the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of which ſeems very incertain, if the different opinions of Authors upon this ſubject be regarded. Some will have them to be the Urine emptied out of the Bladder by the<note n="*" place="margin">Urachus.</note> 
                  <hi>Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raque,</hi> becauſe they cannot find a true and eaſie way for it; and becauſe their colour and ſavour much reſembles the Urine contained in the Bladder: but it is very certain, it cannot be ſo as they ſay, becauſe the <hi>Urachus</hi> is not perforated in the <hi>Faetus,</hi> and it comes not forth of the Navel; for the place where it is faſtened, is alwayes tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and very like a ſmall Luteſtring, through which, it is moſt certain, nothing can paſs, how ſubtil ſoever; as I have often obſerved and ſeen Mr. <hi>Gayant</hi> to note, who is, with univerſal Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the moſt exact and expert Anatomiſt, that hath been this long time in <hi>Paris:</hi> for whoſe merit, his Majeſty hath done him the honour to chooſe him before all others to make thoſe curious Inquiries and many fair Experiments, in which many choiſe and knowing Perſons are continually imployed, who are of the Royal Academy. Now this natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation doth clearly manifeſt that <hi>Laurentius</hi> was abuſed, when he ſaith, that he had ſeen a Man, whoſe <hi>Oraque</hi> was not cloſed, to void a quantity of Water by the Navel; inferring thence, that it came from the Bladder by this <hi>Urachus;</hi> and that which is contained within the Infants Membranes, is amaſſed after the ſame manner. I doubt not but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:171433:93"/>
he ſaw a Man void Water by the Navel, as he ſaith; but it did certainly proceed from the capacity of the lower Belly, where he had a Dropſie, and not from the Bladder; for there is no cavity in the <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> as we have ſaid, at leaſt not, except it be againſt the order of Nature; upon which, in this caſe, we muſt not rely ſo, as to affirm it ought to be ſo in all other ſubjects.</p>
               <p>There are others, who will alſo have theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be the Urine: but they are of an opinion that it paſſeth through the Yard, whoſe paſſage is alwayes open, and not by the <hi>Urachus</hi> which never is hollow.</p>
               <p>For my part, as it appears to me, with more reaſon, and as indeed it is, theſe Waters are only generated out of vaporous humidities, which tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſude and exhale continually out of the Infants bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and meeting theſe Membranes, through which they cannot paſs, becauſe they are too thick and cloſe, are turned into Water, which is thus by little and little collected, as well during the firſt months of Conception, the Child not yet quick, as all the remaining part of the time, after it is: for vapours paſs forth and exhale out of all porous bodies that are hot and moiſt, as is that of an <hi>Embrio;</hi> and the reaſon is very weak, by which they maintain theſe Waters to proceed from the Urine, becauſe they are ſalt, as the Urine is; for Sweat, Tears, and other humours, which diſtill and tranſude out of the body, are as well ſalt as the Urine, of which the Infant, whilſt it is in the Womb, cannot have much, no more than ordeur in the Guts, becauſe at ſuch time it receives no nouriſhment by the mouth, and that all its ſuperfluous humours may
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:171433:93"/>
eaſily paſs away by tranſpiration, through the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all the parts of its body, which is very tender: wherefore I cannot conceive any neceſſity to oblige them more to empty the Urine, which is in a ſmall quantity in the Bladder, than the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements which are in the Guts; which is not then done in any manner, but only after the Child is born. <hi>Bartholinus</hi> and others would however have the Infant to render its Urine through its Yard, and that theſe Waters proceed from thence: but there is a greater probability it ſhould come by tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as I have ſaid; for before it is yet fully ſhaped, and quick, there is notwithſtanding found a proportionable quantity of theſe Waters to the bigneſs of his body: which makes it manifeſt, that it is then neither the Urine rendered by the <hi>Ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> nor the Yard, as all the world imagine: and that which proves it more plainly, is the example of ſome Children born with their Yards not perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, who notwithſtanding have theſe Waters, whilſt they are in their Mothers Womb.</p>
               <p>It muſt be obſerved, that when there is more than one Child, they are never in the ſame Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, unleſs their bodies are joyned and adhering together (which is rare and monſtrous when it happens) but each of them have their Membranes and Waters apart and ſeparated, in which they are each wrapt up by themſelves.</p>
               <p>Theſe Waters thus collected within theſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes have divers very conſiderable uſes. They ſerve the Infant to move it ſelf the more eaſily, as it were by ſwimming from one ſide to the other, and that it may not hurt the Womb by its frequent motions in ſtriking dry againſt it, which would
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:171433:94"/>
cauſe great pain and often excite to abortion: they ſerve alſo very much to facilitate its paſſage in the Birth, making the way very ſlippery, and by that means the orifice of the Womb being moiſtened, is better widened and yeelding when they break,<note n="*" place="margin">Right time of good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> juſt when the Child is ready to follow, or a little before: for elſe, remaining dry, it is born with greater difficulty, and the Mother al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo more tormented by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Claudius de la Corveé,</hi> Phyſitian to the late Queen of <hi>Poland,</hi> in his Book intituled <hi>De Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Faetus,</hi> would have theſe Waters to ſerve the Infant chiefly for nouriſhment, and that it ſucks them by his mouth, and ſwallows them (as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins) whilſt he continues in the Womb: but the truth of the contrary being known to the leaſt Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, it would be but labour in vain to refute all the reaſons he brings to prove and ſupport his ſaying; for they deſtroy themſelves, and do all of them correſpond to the falſhood of their principle.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſufficiently explained the Membrans and Waters of the <hi>Faetus,</hi> we muſt in order inquire after the parts, by means of which it is nouriſhed whilſt in the Womb, which ſhall be our following diſcourſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the <hi>Placenta,</hi> and Umbilical Veſſels of the Child.</head>
               <p>SInce the Infant is only nouriſhed with the Mothers blood whilſt it is in the Womb, and that big-bellyed Women never have any that is fair or good; provident Nature hath formed the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa</hi> to ſerve it for a Magazin, that it may alwaies have ſufficient, and be there again elaborated and perfected, to render it more convenient for its nouriſhment; for without doubt, ſo groſs a blood as the Mothers cannot poſſibly be converted into its delicate ſubſtance, if it were not firſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in the <hi>Placenta,</hi> which is afterwards ſent to it by meanes of the <hi>Umbilical</hi> vein, and brought back, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter, by the Arteries, which are the conduits of which the the Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring is compoſed. We ſay then that the <hi>Placenta</hi> is nothing but a ſpongy and fleſhy maſs, ſomewhat like the ſubſtance of the Spleen, woven and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced with an infinity of Veins and Arteries, which compoſe the greateſt part of its body, made to receive the Mothers blood, appointed for the Infants nouriſhment, which is in the Womb. This maſs of ſpongious fleſh is thus called, becauſe it reſembles in figure a Cake; ſome call it the <hi>Delivery,</hi> becauſe being come forth after the Child is born, the Woman is quite delivered of the burthen of her great-belly: It is likewiſe called
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:171433:98"/>
the <hi>After-burthen,</hi> becauſe it is as a ſecond labour, of which the Woman is not diſcharged till<note n="*" place="margin">Sometimes in flouding it comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Child.</note> after the Child is born: there are ſome which give it the name of the <hi>Uterine</hi> Liver, becauſe they ſay it ſerves as a Liver to prepare the blood appointed for the Infants nouriſhment: and <hi>Laurentius</hi> likes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to call it the<note n="*" place="margin">Sweetbread.</note> 
                  <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas</hi> of the Womb, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the ſame uſe for it, as for the <hi>Pancreas</hi> of the lower belly, to wit, for a reſt and ſupport to the veſſels of the Navel, which diſperſeth an infinite number of branches through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all its ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Placenta</hi> is made of the menſtruous blood of the Mother, which flowes into the Womb, by the accumulation of which is formed this <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matous</hi> maſs; the ſhape of it is flat and round, of about he bigneſs of a Trencher, and two fingers breadth thick towards the middle of it, where the <hi>umbilical</hi> veſſels are faſtned: but it is thinner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the edges of all its whole circumference. It is covered with the <hi>Chorion</hi> and <hi>Amnios</hi> on the ſide next the Infant, and on the other ſide it is joined and faſtened to the bottom on the inſide of the Womb: It is ſtrongeſt faſtened to the Womb (with its circumference) by means of the <hi>Chorion,</hi> as we have hinted already in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapter, which cleaves ſo cloſe to it, by the interlacings of an infinity of Veſſels, which appear very large in its ſurface, that it cannot be ſeparated from it without laceration of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:171433:98"/>If one conſiders diligently, as I have done, the <hi>Placenta</hi> on that ſide which joyns to the Mother, they may perceive that it is alſo indued with a kind of light <hi>membrane,</hi> which is ſo frail and ſmall, that it is almoſt imperceptible: however, it may manifeſtly be diſcerned by wiping away the blood with which it is alwaies coloured.</p>
               <p>There may be again obſerved, that all the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies on this ſide is as it were much interlined, not unlike in ſome meaſure thoſe of an Oxes reins: and there appears likewiſe many ſmall out-lets, by which the blood, that tranſudes through the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſubſtance of the Womb, diſtills into this fleſhy maſs.</p>
               <p>Although there be two Children in the Womb, nay three, if twins, that is to ſay, begotten in the ſame act, they have uſually but one common <hi>After-burthen:</hi> which hath as many Navel-ſtrings faſtened to it, as there are Children; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding are ſeparated one from the other by their ſeveral <hi>membranes,</hi> in each of which the Children are apart with their Waters; if at leaſt (as I have ſaid in the precedent Chapters) their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be not joyned and adhering one to the other; in which caſe the Twins of this kind have as well their Waters in common, as that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the ſame <hi>membranes:</hi> but if they be ſuperfetations, there will be as many burthens as Children: and as ſuperfetation (if there are as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as may poſſibly be) happen but very rarely, ſo there are few Women that have their burthens ſeparated, when they are delivered of ſeveral Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>We ſcarce find any creature but a Woman, that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:171433:99"/>
hath an After-burthen, like what we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and diſchargeth it as uſeleſs, aſſoon as the Child is born; for moſt other Animals caſt forth nothing after their young, except the waters only and ſome ſlime, with the <hi>membranes</hi> which ſurround them; and inſtead of this fleſhy maſs, thoſe, which ordinarily, as a Woman, bring forth but one young at a time, have only ſome <hi>Cotyledons,</hi> which are many ſpongious kernells, joyned inwardly to the proper ſubſtance of their Womb, where terminates all the branches of the <hi>Umbilical</hi> veſſels of their young; which kernells, as I have often obſerved in the diſſecting of ſheep, are not bigger than Hemp ſeed, when they are not with young; but when they are with young, they ſwell extremely, and become of the bigneſs of a thumb, the one bigger, the other leſſer: they then reſemble much the Figure of a round Muſhroom, not yet ſpread, on the wrong ſide, after it be cut from its ſtalk; and to each of thoſe <hi>Cotyledons,</hi> or kernels, are faſtened the <hi>ramifications</hi> of the <hi>umbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi> Veſſels: however it is certain, that the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals which have ordinarily more than one at a time; as Bitches, Rabbits and others, have no <hi>Coty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledons,</hi> inſtead of which each young hath in its <hi>Cellule</hi> a kind of particular <hi>Placenta,</hi> which the dam eats aſſon as ſhe voids it, after ſhe hath gnawed and cut off with her teeth the <hi>Umbelical</hi> veſſel which held it.</p>
               <p>When a big-bellyed Woman hath the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of her whole habit, there is almoſt ever ſome mark and impreſſion either in colour or ſubſtance on the after-burthen, which ſhe voids in her labour; becauſe, it being of a very ſoft ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:171433:99"/>
eaſily imbibes the ill humours of the body, which uſed to be voided by the Womb. Its natural colour ought to be red, and ſo much the fairer and better coloured, as the Woman is in good health; its ſubſtance muſt be whole and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſoft, without the leaſt <hi>ſchirrous</hi> hardneſs.</p>
               <p>From the midſt of the Burthen proceeds a ſtring, compoſed of many veſſels joined together, which ſerve to conduct the blood appointed for the Infants nouriture; the number of them is diſputed amongſt Authors: ſome reckon four, that is, two Veins and two Arteries; others five, adding the <hi>Ourachus</hi> to them; but it is very certain that there are but three only in a humane <hi>Foetus,</hi> as I have found by many diſſections; to wit, one Vein and two Arteries: the vein having ſent forth into the <hi>Placenta</hi> an infinity of branches, like to the roots of a tree, is conducted by a ſingle channel all along the ſtring to the Infants navel, which it paſſeth, to be at laſt terminated in the midſt of the <hi>Fiſſure,</hi> which is in the inferiour part of the Liver; and the two Arteries taking their riſe out of the ſame <hi>Placenta,</hi> from a great number of the like roots, paſs along the ſame ſtring by two conduits, piercing alſo the Infants Navel, and end in its <hi>Iliac</hi> Arteries, and ſometimes in the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſtricks.</hi> The Vein is much bigger than the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; its cavity is capable to admit a writing-quil into it, and thoſe of the Arteries only a ſmall bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin about half the bigneſs of the Vein.</p>
               <p>Theſe three Veſſels compoſing the ſtring, are wrapt up in one <hi>Membrane</hi> thick and ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, proceeding from the <hi>Chorion,</hi> which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is clothed about with a production from the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:171433:100"/>
                  <hi>Amnios,</hi> and may eaſily be ſeparated: but beſides that this firſt ſerves them as a ſheath, in which they are all three lodged, it ſeparates them again one from the other by its duplications; When the veſſels of the ſtring are full of blood, it is then of about the bigneſs of a finger, and ordinarily of the length of a good half Ell, and ſometimes of two thirds, or three quarters. It is neceſſary it ſhould be of this length, that the Infant may have liberty to move it ſelf in the Womb, and to go forth of it at its birth without tearing the After-burthen, to which it is fixed: There are many very plain inequalities, like unto knots, which only proceed from the dilatation of the Veſſels, which being <hi>varicoſe</hi> and fuller of blood in one place than another, cauſeth theſe eminences. Some Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives believe ſuperſtitiouſly, or would make others believe, that the number of theſe pretended knots, anſwers the number of Children the Woman ſhall have afterwards, which is without reaſon; becauſe Women delivered at forty years of age, and of their laſt Child, as we find by daily experience, have as many knots on the Navel-ſtring, as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of twenty years, who may yet have a dozen Children: they ſay further, That if the firſt knot be red, the next Child the Woman ſhall have, will be a Boy; if white, a Girl: but this Propoſition is as ill grounded, as the other; for theſe Knots appear only red, or to ſpeak more properly, of a dark blew, according as the Veſſels are more or leſs full of blood, and eſpecially the Vein which gives it that colour, and is ſo much the more apparent, as it is ſuperficial in that place.</p>
               <p>There are many Authors admit, as we have
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:171433:100"/>
ſaid, the <hi>Ourachus</hi> into the number of theſe <hi>Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> veſſels, ſaying that it ſerves to empty the Childs urine into its <hi>Membranes:</hi> however, experience ſhewes us it is no veſſel, and that it paſſeth not forth of the Navel; but that it is only a <hi>ligament</hi> in a Child, as it is in a Man, which coming from the bottom of the Bladder, terminates at the Navel, without traverſing it, as they have hitherto mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken it. I have opened and diſſected above thirty <hi>Foetus's,</hi> in none of which did I ever find it hollow, but alwaies very ſolid and tendinous, towards the place where it it faſtned to the Navel; and very like, as I have already ſaid, to a ſmall Lute ſtring: Notwithſtanding I ever found it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly hollow in an Ewe, which was terminated with their other <hi>Umbilical</hi> veſſels, at their <hi>Cotyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons;</hi> in which Animals are alſo two <hi>Umbilical</hi> veins to be ſeen, going both near one the other to the Liver, which makes that their Navel-ſtring conſiſts of five Veſſels; but it is not the ſame in a human <hi>Foetus,</hi> for there is but one onely Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Vein, and two Arteries.</p>
               <p>To underſtand well how the nouriſhment is conveyed to the Infant by the <hi>Umbilical</hi> veſſels, it is very neceſſary to conceive and know, in what manner the Blood circulates; which is after this manner. The blood having been conveyed by the mothers Arteries, which end at the bottom of the Womb in the <hi>Placenta,</hi> which is there faſtned, makes a natural transfuſion through the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Vein into the Childs Liver, after which it is carried into the <hi>Vena cava,</hi> and thence to the Heart, whence it is ſent to all the parts by means of the Arteries, and very near a like portion in quantity
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:171433:101"/>
being in the <hi>Iliac</hi> Arteries, is conducted into the <hi>Umbilicals,</hi> which are there terminated, for to be carried back into the <hi>Placenta,</hi> where this blood being again elaborated, returns to make the ſame journey by the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Vein, paſſing again to the Childs Liver, and thence to the Heart, and ſo alwayes ſucceſſively, without the leaſt intermiſſion. But to be able to conceive eaſily how the blood circulates in the <hi>Placenta,</hi> and how by the help of that part is made a mutual transfuſion from the one to the other, as well in reſpect of the Mother, as of the Child; we need but imagine it to be a common part, and depending on both their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: for as to the Mother, the circulation is there made juſt as in her Arm, or any other part of her whatſoever; and as to the Child, it is even the ſame.</p>
               <p>There are no <hi>Valvules</hi> found in the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Vein, though I have curiouſly examined it, nor are any neceſſary: theſe <hi>Valvules</hi> ar every frequent in the Veins of the Arms and Legs; becauſe theſe parts are obliged to make different motions, which compreſſing the Veſſels would trouble thoſe of the blood, if it were not ſo ſuſtained and hindered from recoiling; but the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Vein hath no need of any, becauſe the Navel-ſtring is looſe and floting in the midſt of the waters, where it cannot be compreſt; and therefore the motion of the Blood cannot be there intercepted, as it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Arms and Legs, or other parts where there are ſtrong contractions.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as the Child is born, theſe Veſſels, which are bigger in a <hi>Foetus,</hi> becauſe of their cavity, than they are in a Man, dry up; and that part of them
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:171433:101"/>
which is without the belly, falls off, and is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated cloſe to the Navel five or ſix days after; for which reaſon they loſe their firſt uſe, and begin afterwards to degenerate into ſuſpending Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to wit, the Vein into that of the Liver, and the two Arteries ſerve to extend and ſuſtain the Bladder by the ſides where they are joyned to it, the bottom of which is yet ſuſpended by the <hi>Oura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> which comes not through the Navel, as hath been ſaid, but remains ſo pendant all the reſt of its life. We have hithereo made mention of all thoſe things which are found with the Child in the Womb, let us now ſhow what are the different ſcituations of it in the Womb, according to the different times of Pregnancy: It is a thing of very great conſequence, and deſerves ſome reflections.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the ſeveral natural ſcituations of an Infant in the Mothers Womb, according to the different times of Pregnancy.</head>
               <p>WHen we ſhall have explained the ſeveral natural ſcituations of an Infant, thoſe contrary to Nature, cauſing for the moſt part all ill labours, will eaſily be conceived.</p>
               <p>It may be conſidered that generally the Infants, as well Male as Female, are uſually ſcituated in the midſt of the Womb; for though ſometimes a Womans great Belly is a little higher on the one ſide than the other, yet that is, becauſe the globe of the Womb inclines more that way, and this ſcituation on the ſide muſt be underſtood only in reſpect of the Mothers belly, and not of her Womb, in the midſt of which it is alwaies placed;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:171433:102"/>
becauſe there is but one only cavity in a Womans Womb, marked with a ſmall line in its length, without having two or more ſeparations; as is ſeen in thoſe of other Animals.</p>
               <p>There are ſome who would have theſe two ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary cavities to be the cauſe why Women ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bear Twins, yea and ſometimes more; and that the Males are rather engendered on the right, and Females on the left ſide, which is <hi>Hypocrates</hi>'s opinion in the 48<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> of his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book, where he ſaith, <hi>Foetus Maris dexträ uteri parte, Foeminae ſiniſträ magis geſtantur,</hi> but without any certain reaſon for it; becauſe ſome Women have the Males on the left-ſide, others the Females on the right; and when there are Twins, ſometimes both are of the ſame Sex, ſometimes not, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently ſcituated on the right or the left. This is all can be ſaid in general of the ſcituation of Children in the Womb.</p>
               <p>But in particular, when we conſider the ſeveral Figures it makes, it differs according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times of Pregnancy; for when the Woman is young with Child, the little <hi>Foetus,</hi> called <hi>Embryo,</hi> is alwaies found of a round Figure a little oblong, having the <hi>Spine</hi> moderately turned inwards, the Thighs folded and a little raiſed, to which the Legs are ſo joined, that the Heels touch the Buttocks; the Arms are bending, and the Hands placed upon the Knees, towards which the Head is inclining forwards, ſo that the Chin toucheth the Breaſt. It reſembles, in this poſture very well, one ſitting to void his Excrements, and ſtooping down his head to ſee what comes from him. The <hi>Spine</hi> of its Back is at that time placed towards the Mothers,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:171433:103"/>
the head uppermoſt, the face forwards, and the feet downwards; and proportionable to its growth and grandeur, it extends by little and little its members, which were exactly folded in the firſt months. It keeps uſually this poſture till the <hi>ſeventh</hi> or <hi>eighth</hi> month, at which time the head being grown very big, is carried downwards by its weight, towards the inward orifice of the Womb, tumbling as it were over its head, ſo that then the feet are uppermoſt, and the face towards the Mothers great gut. Some believe that only Males are ſo turned downwards when they are born, and that the Females are with their face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but both the one and the other are alwaies turned downwards, with their face towards the <hi>Rectum</hi> of their Mother, as is aboveſaid, and when it happens otherwiſe, it is unnatural, for the Childs face coming upwards will be extremely bruiſed, and the noſe wholly flatted, becauſe of the bones hardneſs in the paſſage.</p>
               <p>It may be noted, that when the Child hath thus changed its firſt ſcituation, being not yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to this laſt, it ſtirs and torments it ſelf ſo much ſometimes, that the Woman, by reaſon of the pains ſhe feels, is apt to believe it her Labour: And if this circumſtance be well conſidered, they will find it to be that firſt pretended endeavour which Authors imagine the Child makes for to be born in the <hi>Seventh</hi> moneth, and not being able to accompliſh, it remains ſo till the <hi>Ninth,</hi> and that reiterating it in the eighth, if it be born, it lives not long, becauſe it was not able to endure two ſuch puiſſant endeavors ſo near together. But it is a meer abuſe, for if the Child turnes it ſelf ſo
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:171433:103"/>
with the head downwards, or rather is turned, it is but by a natural diſpoſition of the weight of the upper parts of the body, and if it ſtirs much at that time and ſoon after, it is not from a deſire to be born, but from the inconvenience it receives from this new poſture, to which it was not before accuſtomed, as already hath been mentioned: And it begins to turn thus ſometimes from the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> month, rarely before but by accident, ofteneſt about the <hi>eighth</hi> Moneth, and ſometimes in the <hi>ninth</hi> only, and at other times alſo it doth not turn at all, as we way eaſily perceive in thoſe that come in their firſt ſcituation, that is, with their feet foremoſt. From whence it is eaſie to conjecture, and I hold it for a certain truth, that the Children are the more ſtrong and robuſt, and conſequently may more likely live, by how much the nearer they approach to the more natural and perfect time, which is at the end of the <hi>ninth</hi> Month.</p>
               <p>The Infant then is turned on this manner with his Head downwards towards the latter end of the Reckoning, to the end only that he may be the better diſpoſed for its eaſier paſſage into the world at the time of Labour, which is not then far off: For in this poſture all its joints are eaſily extended in comming forth, and the Arms and Legs cannot hinder its birth; becauſe they cannot be bended againſt the inward orifice of the Womb; and the reſt of the body, which is very ſupple, paſſeth very eaſily, after the Head, which is hard and big, be once quite born.</p>
               <p>When there are many Children, they ought, if it be natural, to come in the ſame Figure, as when
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:171433:104"/>
there is but one: but uſually by their different motions they do ſo incommode one the other, that almoſt alwaies one of them preſents wrong at the time of Labour, yea and before; which is the cauſe that one comes often with the Head, the other with the Feet, or any other worſe poſture, and ſometimes both come wrong.</p>
               <p>However the Infant may be ſcituated in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers belly, or in whatſoever faſhion it be that it preſents at the birth, if it be not according to the poſture above deſcribed, it is alwaies againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and the natural ſcituation is ſo neceſſary to a good and legitimate Delivery, that thoſe which are againſt nature, do cauſe for the moſt part bad Labours.</p>
               <p>When a big-bellyed Woman is happily arrived near her haven, ſhe ought then to take great care ſhe ſuffers not ſhipwrack there; which ſhe will avoid, if ſhe obſerves exactly at the end of her reckoning the Rules which follow.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> What a Woman ought to do, when ſhe hath gone her full time.</head>
               <p>I Am not of the opinion of moſt Mid-wives, who adviſe Women with Child (that they may, as they ſay, have the better labour) to uſe more than ordinary exerciſe towards the end of their reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Liebaut</hi> alſo directs, who orders them to ride in Coaches, or trotting Horſes, which is a very
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:171433:104"/>
dangerous advice, and cauſeth daily many wrong Births; for, as we ſaid in the precedent Chapter, 'tis about that time that ordinarily the Child turns its head downwards, and its heels upwards, for to be born right, and the poor Women often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving they may procure an eaſie labour, make it by this extraordinary exerciſe very unhappy, which becauſe of the agitation and commotion of the body, cauſeth the Child to take a wrong po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, or makes the Womb ſo to bear down and be engaged in the cavity of the <hi>Hypogaſtrium,</hi> that afterwards it hath not at due time liberty to be turned; which is often the reaſon, why it comes in its firſt poſture, that is, with the feet, beſides that labour (which ought to be Natures work, if the Child come right) is thereby excited before the full time, and though it were but four or five days, it hinders not, as I have ſaid elſewhere, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as prejudicial to them, as we ſee it is to the taſte, goodneſs, and conſervation of Fruit gathered but few days before its perfect maturity.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I counſel a Woman (though almoſt contrary to the unreaſonable opinion of every one) to keep her ſelf more quiet than ordinary, when ſhe draws near her time, that ſo her Child may be able to turn it ſelf directly right, and that ſhe by all means avoids being ſtrait laced, that ſo it may have more ſpace to be turned into a fit poſture to be born; ſhe muſt then likewiſe obſerve a good diet of meat, of good juyce and eaſie digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather boiled than roſted, to moiſten the better, and keep the body thereby open, rather than by Clyſters, which may haſten labour; ſhe may about <hi>eight</hi> or <hi>ten</hi> days before Labour anoint
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:171433:105"/>
her privities with Gooſe, Capon, or Hogs Greaſe or freſh Butter: or foment thoſe parts with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, which may by mollifying and looſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, render thoſe paſſages more ſmooth and ſlippery. This ought principally to be done by thoſe that go with their firſt Child; becauſe their paſſages are more ſtrait than others who have had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren already: but they who are a little in years, have much more pain, and are longer in Labour of their firſt Child, than others who are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent young; becauſe the Membranes of their Womb are harder and dryer; wherefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yeeld ſo well, nor the inward Orifice be ſo eaſily dilated.</p>
               <p>Some Authors commend bathing, the better to relax thoſe parts; but it is dangerous, leſt by their too much moiſtneſs, and the emotion they cauſe to the whole Body, they make her come a little before her time. Many Women bleed by way of prevention, when they are, or believe themſelves to be at their full time; which cuſtom I cannot approve, if it be only for prevention; but I do, in caſe ſome other neceſſity require it, provided they abſtain from it after the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Moneth; becauſe the ſtirring of the Child, cauſed by bleeding, is ſometimes ſo vehement, that the Womb is conſtrained to open, before its time to be rid of the Child. If a Woman with Child ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves theſe Rules, ſhe will have reaſon to hope for a good iſſue of her Labour: in the mean time let her provide her ſelf of a good Midwife or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert and handy<note n="*" place="margin">Chyrurgeons onely Practiſe in <hi>France,</hi> as noted before.</note> Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, to attend upon her aſſoon as ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives

the leaſt pain or throw, of what kind ſoever; for as a ſmall wind, or ſhake, will ſerve turn to make ripe fruit fall, ſo the leaſt Cholick, or any other falſe pain, may bring forward her Labour, and ſurpriſe her unprovided of help: Let us now ſee what is neceſſary when ſhe is effectively in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> What is to be done when the Woman firſt falls in Labour.</head>
               <p>A Womans travel is only many pains with rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated Throws, by which ſhe endeavours to bring forth her Child: It is ſo called, becauſe both Mother and Child ſuffer and take much pains in this action. Moſt people believe that there is no other reaſon for the cauſe of this evil, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath ſo ordained it, and that Woman, according to his Word, muſt bring forth with pain, becauſe of her ſin, according to what is written in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Chap. of <hi>Geneſis, I will greatly multiply thy ſorrow and thy conception, in ſorrow thou ſhalt bring forth Children, and thy deſire ſhall be to thy Husband</hi> — This curſe was indeed very great, becauſe it hath extended to all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have brought forth Children ſince that time, and will continue to all that ſhall come hereafter. However we find that all the Females of other Animals ſuffer as much, and are in as great danger of their lives as a Woman, when they bear their young. This perſwades us, that,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:171433:106"/>
beſides this preciſe will of God in reſpect of a Woman, there muſt be yet a natural reaſon, wherefore it cannot happen otherwiſe, and that is, That it is impoſſible the Womb, being very ſtrait in compariſon of the Childs bigneſs, and very ſenſible, becauſe of its <hi>Membranous</hi> compoſition, ſhould receive a neceſſary dilatation for the Childs birth, and ſuch great violence, without ſuffering conſiderable pains for it. Now ſince a Woman, for this cauſe, cannot ſhun theſe pains, ſhe muſt endeavour to endure them with patience, in the hope of being ſuddenly delivered from them by a fortunate labour.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as it is known that the Woman is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in Labour, by the ſigns mentioned in the <hi>Second</hi> Chapter of this Book, where both thoſe preceding and thoſe accompanying Labour are recited; of which the principal are, Pains and ſtrong Throws in the Belly, forcing downwards towards the Womb: the dilatation of the inward Orifice, perceived by touching it with the finger: as alſo the gathering of the Waters, which come before the Head of the Child, and thruſting down the Membranes which contain them, through which between the Pains one may in ſome manner with the Finger diſcover the part which preſents, eſpecially if it be the Head of the Child, by its roundneſs and hardneſs: Then muſt all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to comfort the Woman in her Labour be go ready; and the better to help her, care muſt be taken, that ſhe be not ſtrait-laced; a pretty ſtrong Clyſter may be given her, or more than one, if there be occaſion; which muſt be done at the

beginning and before the Child be too forwards, for afterwards it is very difficult for her to receive them, becauſe the Gut is too much compreſſed: they ſerve to excite it to diſcharge it ſelf of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, that ſo the <hi>Rectum</hi> being emptied, there may be more ſpace for the dilatation of the paſſage, as alſo to ſtirr up the pains to bear the better downwards, through the endeavours ſhe makes when ſhe is at ſtool, and the while all neceſſary things for her Labour ſhould be put in order, as well for the Woman, as the Child, a Midwifes ſtool, or rather a Pallet-Bed girted, placed cloſe by the fire, if the ſeaſon require it; which Pallet ought to be ſo diſingaged, as to be turned round about, the better to help the Woman when there is occaſion.</p>
               <p>If the Woman be<note n="*" place="margin">full of blood.</note> Plethorick, it may be convenient to bleed her a little, for by this means, her Breaſt being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged, and her reſpiration free, ſhe will have more ſtrength to bear down her pains, which ſhe may do without danger, becauſe the Child being about that time ready to be born, hath no more need of the Mothers blood for its nouriſhment; which I have often practiſed with good ſucceſs: beſides this evacuation often hinders her having a Fever after Delivery, in expectation of which hour ſhe may walk about her Chamber, if her ſtrength permits; and to preſerve her ſtrength, it will be convenient to give ſome good gelly broths, new-laid eggs, or ſome ſpoonfuls of burnt or brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wine, from time to time, or a Toſt dipt in Wine, avoiding at that time ſolid food. Above all ſhe muſt be perſwaded to hold out her pains,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:171433:107"/>
bearing them down as much as ſhe can, at the inſtant when they take her: The Midwife muſt from time to time taſte the inward orifice with her finger, to know whether the Waters are ready to break, and whether the Birth will ſoon after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: ſhe muſt likewiſe anoint all the bearing place with <hi>emollient</hi> Oyles, Hogs-greaſe, or freſh Butter, if ſhe perceive that they can hardly be dilated, and all the while ſhe muſt be near her Woman, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her geſtures diligently, her complaints and pains, for by this they gueſs pretty well, how the Labour advanceth, without being obliged to taſte her body ſo often.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>de la Cuiſſe</hi> deceaſed, who often ſlept near the Woman in Labour, was ſo uſed to it, that he never awaked till juſt the Child was in the paſſage, at which time the Woman changeth her moans into loud cries, which ſhe ſtrongly repeats, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the greater and more frequent pains which ſhe then feels: the Patient may likewiſe by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals reſt her ſelf on her bed, for to regain her ſtrength: but not too long, eſpecially little, or ſhort thick Women, for they have alwaies worſe Labours if they lye much on their beds in their Travail, and yet much worſe of their firſt Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, than when they are prevailed with to walk about the Chamber, ſupporting them under their arms, if neceſſary; for by this means, the weight of the Child (the Woman being on her Legs) cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the inward orifice of the Womb to dilate ſooner than in bed; and her pains to be ſtronger and frequenter, that her Labour be nothing near ſo long.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:171433:107"/>Qualms and Vomitings, which often happen to Women in Labour, ought not to amaze any, for on the contrary, it furthers the Throws and Pains provoking downwards: we ſhewed the cauſe of this Vomiting in the <hi>Second</hi> Chapter of this Book, and the reaſon why it is not dangerous.</p>
               <p>When the Waters of the Child are ready and gathered, which may be perceived through the Membranes to preſent themſelves to the inward ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, of the bigneſs of the whole dilatation, the Midwife ought to let them break of themſelves, and not as ſome, that impatient of the long La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, break them; intending to haſten their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which on the contrary they retard by ſo doing, before the Infant be wholly in the paſſage; for by the too haſty breaking of theſe Waters, which ought to ſerve him to ſlide forth with greater facility, he remains dry, which hinders after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pains and Throws from being ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to bring forth the Infant, as elſe they would have been; it is therefore better to let them break of themſelves, and then the Midwife may eaſily feel the Child bare, by the part which firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and ſo judge certainly whether it comes right, that is with the Head, which ſhe ſhall find hard, big, round, and equal; but if it be any other part, ſhe will perceive ſomething inequal, and rugged, and hard or ſoft, more or leſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the part it is. Immediately after<note n="*" place="margin">That being the right time when all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ought to be delivered, if nature perform its office.</note> let her diſpatch to deliver her Woman, if ſhe be not already, and aſſiſt the Birth, which ordinarily happens ſoon after, if natural, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:171433:108"/>
may be done according to the directions in the next Chapter: But if ſhe finds the Child to come wrong, and that ſhe is not able to deliver the Woman<note n="*" place="margin">Mark, 'tis not enough to lay a Woman, if it might be done by another, with more ſafety and caſe to either or both.</note> as ſhe ought to be, by helping Nature, and ſo ſave both Mother and Child, who both are in danger of their lives, let her ſend ſpeedily for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert and dextrous Chyrurgeon in the practice, and not delay as too many of them very often do, till it be reduced to extremity.</p>
               <p>There are many Midwives, who are ſo afraid that the Chirurgeons ſhould take away their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, or to appear ignorant before them,<note n="*" place="margin">Good avoiding ſuch Midwives if Women value their lives.</note> that they chuſe rather to put all to adventure, then to ſend for them in neceſſity: others are ſo preſumptuous, as to believe themſelves as capable as the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons to undertake all. And ſome there are indeed, who are not ſo wicked, yet for want of knowledg and experience in their Art, hope ſtill in vain, that the Child in time may change to a better poſture, and that the accidents will ceaſe (if it pleaſe God, as they ſay); and ſome do malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly put ſuch a terrour and apprehenſion of the Chirurgeons in the poor Woman,<note n="*" place="margin">For the moſt part undeſervedly.</note> characterizing them like butchers and hangmen, that they chooſe rather to dye in Travail with the Child in their Womb, than to put themſelves into their hands: But indeed ſuch Midwives do
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:171433:108"/>
more juſtly deſerve this fair title, unleſs they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves with more prudence and equal conſcience in ſo important an occaſion, and ſend<note n="*" place="margin">A neceſſary note.</note> in time for ſome help in their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, before the Child be (as very often) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a wrong poſture in the paſſage, ſo as it is almoſt impoſſible to give it a better, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream violence to the Woman, which is alſo the cauſe of the death of the Child; and they would be ſo far from loſing their reputation, that they would augment it, becauſe by ſo doing, it would be manifeſt they were not ignorant of the danger both of time and place; and the Chirurgeon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called, aſſoon as neceſſity required it, could have no juſt cauſe to impute any ill conſequence of the Labour to them, though it ſhould ſo fall out, and rheir conſcience would be diſcharged of it: for in this caſe (as we have ſaid) both the Mothers and Childs life is at ſtake.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon then as the Waters are broke, and the Midwife finds the Child to come wrong, ſhe muſt adviſe the Woman not to forward her Pains, leſt by bearing down ſhe engage the Child too much in the paſſage, and ſo give the Chirurgeon more pains to turn it, and muſt ſend for him aſſoon as may be, for to deliver her as occaſion requires, and according as ſhall be directed hereafter in this Book.

               <p>The Bed muſt be ſo made, that the Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to be delivered, ſhould lye on her back upon it, having her body in a convenient Figure, that is, her Head and Breaſt a little raiſed, ſo that ſhe be neither lying nor ſitting; for in this manner ſhe breathes beſt, &amp; will have more ſtrength to help her Pains, than if ſhe were otherwiſe, or ſunk down in her Bed. Being in this poſture, ſhe muſt ſpread her Thighs abroad, folding her Legs a little towards her Buttocks, ſomewhat raiſed by a ſmall Pillow underneath, to the end that the <hi>Coxcyx,</hi> or Rump, ſhould have more liberty to retire back, and have her Feet ſtayed againſt ſome firm thing; beſides this, let her hold ſome perſons with her hands, that ſhe may the better ſtay her ſelf during her Pains. She being thus placed near the ſide of her Bed (with her Midwife by, the better to help up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion) muſt take courage and help her Pains the beſt ſhe can, bearing them down when they
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:171433:111"/>
take her, which ſhe may do by holding her breath, &amp; forcing her ſelf all ſhe can, juſt as when ſhe goeth to Stool; for by ſuch endeavors, the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> being ſtrongly thruſt downwards, doth force down the Womb and Child in it; in the mean time the Midwife muſt comfort her, and deſire her to endure her Labour bravely, putting her in hopes of a ſpeedy Delivery. Some would have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Woman at that time to preſs the ſuperior parts of her Belly, and ſo to thruſt gently the Child downwards; but I am not of their opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch compreſſions will rather hurt then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, by indangering the bruiſing of the Womb, which is extream ſore at that time; and I have ſeen ſome Women, very ill afterwards, for having been uſed in this manner. But the Midwife may content her ſelf only (having neither Ring nor Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let on, and her Hand anointed with Oyl or freſh Butter) to dilate gently the inward orifice of the Womb, putting her Fingers ends into its entry, and ſtretching them one from the other, when the Pains take her, for to endeavour to forward the Child, &amp; thruſting by little and little the ſides of the Orifice, towards the hinder part of the Childs Head, anointing theſe parts alſo with freſh Butter, if it be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>When the Infants Head begins to advance into this inward Orifice, tis commonly ſaid it is crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it girds and ſurrounds it, juſt as a Crown, and when it is ſo far that the extremity begins to appear manifeſtly without the Privy-parts, it is then ſaid that the Child is in the Paſſage, and the Woman in Travail imagines (although un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly, and it may be is not ſo much as touched by
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:171433:111"/>
her) that her Midwife hurts her with her Fingers, finding her ſelf as it were ſcratched and pricked with pins in thoſe parts, becauſe of the violent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtention and ſometimes Laceration, which the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Childs head cauſeth there.</p>
               <p>When things are in this poſture, the Midwife muſt ſeat her ſelf conveniently to receive the Child, which will ſoon come, and with her Fingers ends, her Nails being cloſe pared, endeavour to thruſt (as aboveſaid) this crowning of the Womb back over the Head of the Child, and aſſoon as it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as far as the Ears, or thereabouts, ſhe may take hold of the two ſides with her two hands, that when a good Pain comes ſhe may quickly draw forth the Child, taking care that the Navel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring be not then intangled about the Neck, or any other part, leſt thereby the After-burthen be pulled with violence, and poſſibly the Womb alſo to which it is faſtened, and ſo cauſe flooding, or elſe break the ſtring, whereby the Woman may come to be more difficulty delivered. It muſt alſo be obſerved that the Head be not drawn forth ſtrait, but ſhaking it a little from one ſide to the other, that the Shoulders may the ſooner and eaſier take its place, immediately after it be paſt, which muſt be done without loſing any time, leſt the Head being paſt, the Child be ſtopt thereby the bigneſs and largeneſs of the Shoulders, and be in danger of being ſuffocated and ſtrangled in the paſſage: but aſſoon as the Head is born, if there be need, ſhe may ſlide in her Fingers under the Arm-pits, and the reſt of the Body will follow without any difficulty.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as the Midwife hath in this manner
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:171433:112"/>
drawn forth the Child, ſhe muſt put it on one ſide, leſt the Blood and Waters, which follows immediatly after, ſhould incommode it, or it may be choak it, by falling into its Mouth or Noſe, as it would do, if it were laid on the back; after which there remains nothing but to free her from the After-burthen, which I will ſhow how in the next Chapter: but before that, let her be very careful to examine, whether there be no more Children in the Womb; for it happens very often that there are two and ſometimes more, which ſhe may eaſily know, by the continuance of the Pains after the Child is born, and the bigneſs of the Mothers belly; beſides this ſhe may be very ſure of it, if ſhe puts her Hand up the entry of the Womb, and finds there another Water gathering, and a Child in it preſenting to the paſſage; if it be ſo, ſhe muſt have a care not to go about to fetch the After-birth, till the Woman be delivered of all her Children, if ſhe have never ſo many, becauſe Twins never have but one Burthen, to which there are faſtned as many Strings and diſtinct Membranes as there are Children; and if one ſhould go to draw it forth aſſoon as the firſt is born, the reſt would be in danger of their lives, becauſe that part is very neceſſary to them, whilſt they are in the Womb, and beſides it endangers a flooding. Wherefore the firſt String muſt be cut, being firſt tyed with a thread <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> double, as we ſhall ſhew more exactly hereafter, and faſten the other end with a ſtring to the Womans Thigh, not ſo much for fear that the String ſhould enter again into the Womb, as to prevent the inconvenience it may cauſe to the Woman by hanging between her
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:171433:112"/>
Thighs; afterwards, this Child being removed, they muſt take care to deliver her of the reſt, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving all the ſame circumſtances as was to the firſt; which being done, it will be then convenient to fetch the After-birth, as we ſhall ſhew in the following Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> How to fetch the After-burthen.</head>
               <p>MOſt Animals, when they have brought forth their young, caſt forth nothing elſe but ſome Waters, and the Membranes which contained them; but Women have an After-birth, of which after Labour they muſt be delivered, as of a thing uſeleſs and inconvenient: Wherefore aſſoon as the Child is born, before they do ſo much as tye or cut the Navel-ſtring, leſt the Womb cloſe, they muſt without loſing time free the Woman from this fleſhy maſs, which was deſtined to furniſh the Infant with Blood for its nouriſhment, whilſt it was in the Womb, and which at that time is called with much reaſon the After-birth, becauſe it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Child, and is to the Woman like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Birth; for being brought forth, ſhe is totally delivered.</p>
               <p>To perform this, the Midwife having taken the ſtring, muſt winde it once or twice about one or two of her Fingers of her left Hand joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the better to hold it, with which ſhe may then draw it moderately, and with the right hand
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:171433:113"/>
ſhe may only take a ſingle hold of it above the leſt near the Privities, drawing likewiſe with that very gently, reſting the while the Fore-finger of the ſame hand extended and ſtretched forth along the String towards the entry of the <hi>Vagina,</hi> as may be ſeen in the annexed Figure; alwaies obſerving, for the more facility, to draw it from the ſide where the Burthen cleaves leaſt, for in ſo doing the reſt will ſeparate the better; juſt as we ſee a Card which is glewed to any thing, is better ſeparated from the place where it begins to part, then where it is cloſe joyned.</p>

               <p>Aſſoon as the Woman is delivered of both Child and Burthen: it muſt then be conſidered, whether there be all, and care had that not the leaſt part of it remain behind, not ſo much as the Skirts or any Clods of Blood, which ought all to be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the firſt; for otherwiſe, being retained, they cauſe great Pains: all which being done, things fit for Mother and Child, in this condition, muſt be provided, which we will mention in their place.</p>
               <p>When a Woman hath two Children, ſhe muſt be delivered in the ſame manner as if ſhe had but one, obſerving only, for the reaſons given in the precedent Chapter, not to fetch the Burthen, till all the Children are born; and then it may be done without danger, ſhaking and drawing it alwaies
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:171433:115"/>
gently, ſometimes by one String, ſometimes the other, and ſometimes by both together, and ſo by turns till all is come, proceeding in it according to the directions already given.</p>
               <p>When the Infant comes right and naturally, the Woman is brought to Bed and delivered with little help, obſerving what hath been taught in the two laſt Chapters, of which the meaneſt Midwives are capable, and oft times for want of them, a ſimple Nurſ-keeper may ſupply the place: but when it is a wrong Labour, there is a greater myſtery belongs to it, for then the skill and prudence of a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon is for the moſt part requiſite.

                  <hi>CHAP X.</hi> Of laborious and difficult Labours, and thoſe againſt Nature, their Cauſes and Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, together with the means to remedy them.</head>
               <p>FOr the eaſier and better explaining theſe things, we ſay, that there are three ſorts of bad La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: to wit, the Painful or Laborious; the Difficult; and that which is altogether contrary to Nature.</p>
               <p>The Laborious is a bad Labour, in which the Mother and Child (though it comes right) ſuffer very much, and are haraſſed more than ordinary:</p>
               <p>The Difficult is not much unlike the firſt, but
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:171433:115"/>
beſides is accompanied with ſome accident which retards it, and cauſeth the difficulty: but the wrong Labour, or that againſt Nature, is cauſed by the bad ſcituation of the Child, and can never be helped but by manual Operation, or the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons hand. In the laborious and difficult La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Nature alwaies doth the Work, being a little aſſiſted: but in that contrary to Nature, all its endeavors are vain and uſeleſs, and there is then no help but in an expert Chirurgeon, without whom ſhe muſt certainly periſh.</p>
               <p>The Difficulties of Labour proceed either from Mother, Child, or both.</p>
               <p>From the Mother, by reaſon of the indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Body; or it may be from ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular part only, and chiefly the Womb: or alſo from ſome ſtrong paſſion of the Mind, with which ſhe was before poſſeſt.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of her Body, either becauſe ſhe may be too Young, having the Paſſages too ſtrait, or too old of her firſt Child; becauſe her parts are too dry and hard, and cannot be ſo eaſily dilated, as happens alſo to them, which are too lean: they who are either ſmall, ſhort, or miſhapen, as crooked Women, have not a Breaſt ſtrong enough to help their Pains, and to bear them down; nor thoſe that are weak, whether naturally or by accident; and crooked perſons have ſometimes the Bones of the Paſſage not well conformed: the tender and too apprehenſive of Pain, have more trouble than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe it hinders them from doing their endeavour: and they likewiſe who have ſmall Pains and ſlow, or have none at all. Great Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks hinder Labour alſo, by preventing the true
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:171433:116"/>
Paius: all great and acute diſeaſes make it very troubleſome and of a bad conſequence, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s opinion in the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Aphoriſm of the <hi>Fifth</hi> Book; <hi>Mulierem gravidam morbo quopiam acuto corripi, lethale.</hi> As when ſhe is taken with a violent Feaver, a great Flooding, frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, Dyſentery, or any other great diſtemper. Excrements retained, cauſe much difficulty, as a Stone in the Bladder, or when it is full of Urine, without being able to void it; or when the great Gut is repleted with hard Ordure, or the Woman troubled with great and painful Piles, and their ill ſcituation ſometimes retard it extremely.</p>
               <p>As touching the difficulty proceeding from the Womb only, it muſt either be from its bad Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Conformation, having its Neck too ſtrait, hard, or callous, whether naturally, or by any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, as having had there a Tumor, Apoſtume, or Ulcer, or Superfluous fleſh, whether on the Neck, or inward Orifice: or becauſe of any <hi>Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice</hi> cauſed by a preceding bad Travail.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, thoſe things which are or may be contained in the Womb with the Child, do alſo cauſe difficult Travail; as when the Membranes are ſo ſtrong, that they cannot be broken, which ſometimes hinders them from advancing into the Paſſage; or ſo tender, that the Waters break too ſoon, for then the Womb remains dry: When there is a <hi>Mole;</hi> or the After-burthen comes firſt, which alwaies cauſeth flooding, and certainly the death of the Infant, if the Woman be not preſently delivered of them by Nature or Art; yea and when the Navel-ſtring comes firſt, the Child is ſuffocated, if not ſpeedily after born; ſtrong Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:171433:116"/>
of the Mind do likewiſe contribute much to it, as Fear, Sorrow, and others the like. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that miſcarries hath more pain than a Woman at her full time, as alſo than one that is hurt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe be very near her time.</p>
               <p>As to the hinderances cauſed by the Infant, they are, when either its Head or whole Body are too large; when the Belly is <hi>Hydropical;</hi> when it is monſtrous, having two Heads, or being joyned to another Child, Mole, or any other ſtrange thing; when it is dead, or ſo weak, that it contributes nothing to its Birth; when it comes wrong; or when there are two or more: beſides all theſe different difficulties of Labour, there is yet one cauſed by the Midwife's ignorance, who for want of underſtanding her buſineſs, inſtead of helping, hinders Nature in its work.</p>
               <p>Let us now treat of the means, by which all theſe may be prevented, and the Woman ſuccoured in her bad and difficult Labour, as may eaſily be done, if we perfectly know the cauſes of all theſe difficulties; as when it happens by the Mothers being too young and too ſtrait, ſhe muſt be gently treated, and the paſſages anointed with Oyl, Greaſe, and freſh Butter, uſing theſe things a long time before the Hour of Labour, to relax and dilate them the eaſier, leſt there ſhould happen a rupture of any part, when the Child is born: for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there happens a dilaceration to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which both are rent into one outwardly. If a Woman be in years of her firſt Child, let her lower parts be likewiſe anointed to mollify the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward orifice, and the <hi>Vagina</hi> or Neck of the Womb, which being more hard and <hi>callous,</hi> do

not eaſily yield to the neceſſary diſtenſion of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; which is the cauſe why ſuch Women are longer in Labour than others, and why their Children (being forced againſt the inward orifice of their Womb, which is, as we have ſaid, a little <hi>callous,</hi> and alſo for remaining long in the paſſage) are born with great Bumps and Bruiſes on their Heads: Small and miſhapen Women ſhould not be put to Bed, till at leaſt their Waters be broke; but rather kept upright and walking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Chamber, if they have ſtrength, being ſupported under the Arms; for in that manner they will breath more freely, and mend their Pains better, than on the Bed, where they lye all on a heap. Let thoſe that are very lean, alſo moiſten theſe parts with Oyls and Oyntments, to make them more ſmooth and ſlippery, that the Head of the Infant and the Womb be not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and bruiſed by the hardneſs of the Mothers bones, which form the Paſſage.</p>
               <p>The weak Woman ſhould be ſtrengthened, the better to ſupport her Pains, giving her good jelly Broths, with a little Wine and a Toſt in it, or other good things as the caſe requires.</p>
               <p>If ſhe fears the Pains, let her be comforted, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring her, that ſhe will not endure many more, but be ſpeedily delivered: On the contrary, if her Pains be ſlow and ſmall, or none at all, they muſt be provoked by frequent Clyſters a little ſtrong, that ſo they may be excited by the needings at Stool, and afterwards let her walk about her Chamber, that the weight of the Child may alſo help a little. If the Woman floods, or hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:171433:117"/>
                  <hi>(which is by many too long neglected)</hi> ſhe muſt be helped by a ſpeedy Delivery, as we have already declared, and ſhall repeat hereafter in its proper place. If ſhe be coſtive, let her uſe Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which likewiſe may diſſipate a Cholick, at thoſe times very troubleſome, cauſing great and uſeleſs Pains, very hurtful, becauſe they fleet to and again through the Belly, without bearing down, as they ſhould do. If ſhe cannot make water, becauſe the Womb bears too much on the Bladder, let her try, by lifting up her Belly a little, or elſe by introducing a <hi>Catheter</hi> into her Bladder, draw forth her Urine.</p>
               <p>If the difficulty or ſlowneſs of the Labour comes from the ill Poſture of the Woman, let her be placed in a better, more convenient to her Habit and Stature, obſerving the circumſtances given in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Chapter of this <hi>Second</hi> Book. If ſhe be taken with any diſtemper, ſhe muſt be treated for it according to its nature, with more caution than at another time, having alwaies regard to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition. If it proceed only from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions of the Womb, either from its oblique ſcituation, it muſt be remedied as well as can be, by the placing of her Body accordingly. If it be by its vitious conformation, having the Neck too hard, and too callous, and too ſtrait, it muſt be anointed with Oyls and Ointments, as above di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
               <p>If it come from a ſtrong Cicatrice, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be mollified, of a preceding Ulcer, or a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of a former bad Labour ſo agglutinated, it muſt be ſeparated with a fit Inſtrument, leſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Laceration happen in a new place, and leave

the Woman in a worſe condition than before; it muſt be made in that place where the caſe moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it; taking care that it be not upwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Bladder. If the Membranes be ſo ſtrong, as that the Waters do not break in due time, they may be broken with the Fingers,<note n="*" place="margin">Let the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife be firſt well aſſured.</note> provided the Child be come very forward into the Paſſage, and ready to follow preſently after; for otherwiſe there is danger, that by breaking theſe Waters too ſoon, the Child will remain dry a long time; and to ſupply that defect, you muſt moiſten the parts with Fomentations, Decoctions and Emollient Oyls; which can never be ſo well, as when Nature doth its own work with the Waters and ordinary Slime, which alwaies happen well when they come in time and place.</p>
               <p>Sometimes theſe <hi>Membranes</hi> with the Waters preſs <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> Fingers breadth out of the body before the Child, reſembling a Bladder full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; there is then no great danger to break them, if they be not already: for when it ſo happens, the Child is alwaies ready to follow being in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: but above all be careful not to pull it with your Hand, leſt thereby you looſen, before its time, the After-burthen, to which it adheres very ſtrongly. If the Navel-ſtring comes firſt, it muſt be preſently put up again, and kept up if poſſible, or elſe the Woman muſt be immediately delivered: But if the After-burthen comes firſt, it muſt never be put up again; for being come forth, it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſeleſs to the Infant, and would be but an obſtacle and hinderance in the way; if it were put
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:171433:118"/>
up in this Caſe, it muſt be cut off, having tyed the Navel-ſtring, and afterwards draw forth the Child aſſoon as may be, leſt that he be ſuffocated.</p>
               <p>If the Woman hath fallen, or is hurt, let her immediately keep her Bed and take her reſt: If it be any Paſſion that retards the Labour, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not totally be overcome, let them endeavour to moderate it: If it be Shamefaſtneſs or Modeſty, the perſons who are the cauſe of it muſt quit the Chamber; and if timidity and fear of Pain, ſhe muſt be adviſed, that it is the will of God it ſhould be ſo, and that her Labour will not be ſo bad as ſhe imagines, perſwading her to ſubmit to the neceſſity, by the conſolation of the unfortunate, whoſe pain ſeems always more ſupportable by the conſideration that it is common; ſo ſhe muſt be informed that others endure the ſame Pain, and greater than hers: if ſhe be melancholy, let her be diverted by ſome good news, promiſing her ſuch a Child as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; and in a word (though ſhe ſuffer much) ſhe muſt conſider it but as a bad journey, which one quarter of an hour of good Weather makes one forget all paſt, as ſhe will, when ſhe is brougt to bed, aſſuring her chiefly that ſhe is in no danger, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when it is not very apparent, for then one ought to acquaint her with it, that ſhe may ſettle both her temporal and ſpiritual affairs.</p>
               <p>When the difficulty is only cauſed by a dead Child, the method mentioned in the natural La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour muſt be obſerved; and beſides, the Woman muſt do all ſhe can to further her Delivery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Child can do nothing, nor can it when it is very weak: She muſt take the while ſome Comfortatives to prevent fainting, becauſe of the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:171433:119"/>
putrid vapours aſcending from the dead Child; but when it hath ſo great a Dropſy, either in the Head or Belly, as that it cannot be born, becauſe of the great diſtenſion and bigneſs of theſe parts, then we are obliged to open theſe parts to let out the Water: And if it be of ſuch enormons bigneſs, either Head or Body, or that it have two Heads, or is joined to another Child, or to a big Mole, there is a neceſſity for to ſave the Mother, either to dilate the paſſage proportionable to the bigneſs of the monſtrous Child (if it be poſſible) or elſe, which is better, to draw forth the Child by pieces, to prevent the Mothers periſhing together with the Child, which elſe would certainly happen, if this courſe be not taken: And if there be two Children, the Rules given in the <hi>Eighth</hi> Chapter of this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Book muſt be obſerved. But if the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife cannot remedy all theſe accidents, ſhe muſt then readily ſend for<note n="*" place="bottom">By all which may be learnt, That if the Midwife cannot lay the Woman aſſoon as, or ſoon after the Water is broke, ſhe ought in time to ſend for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and help.</note> an expert Chirurgeon for his advice, or to do what he thinks fit.

               <p>THoſe Labours which abſolutely require Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Operation are, when the Child comes wrong. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Naturâ Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri,</hi> and in that <hi>De Superfoetatione,</hi> admits but of three general ways for a Child to be born; to wit, with the Head firſt, which is the ſole<note n="*" place="margin">For if any part but the Crown, ſo that the Body fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not in a ſtrait line, 'tis a wrong &amp; difficult Birth, though the Head preſents firſt.</note> natural Figure, when it comes right; the ſecond with the Feet; and the third with the Side or acroſs: which two laſt are quite contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But to make it more plain, we ſay, That a Child may come wrong four ſeveral general waies, which are; Firſt, any of the fore-parts of the Body. Secondly, any of the hinder-parts. Thirdly, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. And Fourthly, the Feet. Now juſt as there are four Cardinal points, to which all the reſt of the thirty two Winds may be reduced on the Compaſs, and to one of the four more than to the other, according as they participate of more or leſs of that Point: ſo likewiſe all the particular and different wrong Poſtures, that a Child may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:171433:120"/>
can be reduced to the abovenamed four gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral waies, according as they approach more to the one than the other of them. And as the number of the ſeveral wrong Births is very great, we will be contented only to treat particularly of each of the principal of them; becauſe if one be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of theſe, they may eaſily remedy the reſt, which are of no great conſequence: but before we mention the means how, it will be convenient to ſhew what conditions are requiſite in a<note n="*" place="margin">Phyſician or any elſe that practiſeth this art.</note> Chirurgeon, that would apply himſelf to this Operation, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations he ought to make before he undertakes it.</p>
               <p>Theſe conditions either reſpect his Body or his Mind; in reſpect of his perſon, he muſt be health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſtrong and robuſt; becauſe this is the moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and painful of all the operations of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery; for it will make one ſometimes ſweat, that he ſhall not have a dry thread, though it were the coldeſt day in Winter, becauſe of the great pains and difficulty he ordinarily meets with, as <hi>Fabricius</hi> of <hi>Aquapendente</hi> teſtifies; confeſſing that he hath often been ſo weary and tired, as that he hath been forced to leave the work for his men to finiſh. He ought to be well ſhaped, at leaſt to outward appearance; but above all, to have ſmall hands, for the eaſier introduction of them into the Womb when neceſſary; yet ſtrong, with the Fingers long, eſpecially the Forefinger, the better to reach and touch the inner Orifice: He muſt have no Rings on his Fingers, and his Nails well pared, when he goeth about the work, for fear of hurting
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:171433:120"/>
the Womb: He ought to have a pleaſant counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to be as neat in his clothes as in his perſon, that the poor Women who have need of him, be not affrighted at him. Some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that a Practitioner of this Art ought on the contrary to be ſlovenly, at leaſt very careleſs, wearing a threat Beard, to prevent the occaſion of the Husbands jealouſy that ſends for him. Truely ſome believe this policy augments their practice, but 'tis fit they ſhould be diſabuſed; for ſuch a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and Dreſs reſembles more a Butcher than a Chirurgeon, whom the Woman apprehends alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too much, that he needs not ſuch a Diſguiſe: above all, he muſt be ſober, no Tipler, that ſo he may at all times have his wits about him; he muſt be diſcreet, modeſt, and ſecret, never diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to ſtrangers thoſe incommodities and diſeaſes of Women which come to his knowledge; He muſt be ſage, prudent, and judicious, to conduct him alwayes in his Operations, with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: He muſt be pittiful, yet not ſo as to diſtract or hinder him from his duty, when the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; as alſo ſo patient, as not to precipitate any thing, but taking time ſufficient to conſider what is fit to be done. He muſt not be angry with the poor Woman, though ſhe exclaims againſt him, or the other Women during the Operation; for the Pains of the one, and the compaſſion of the reſt, oblige them to it without other cauſe. He ſhould be a good Chriſtian, of a well regulated Conſcience, and do his beſt endeavour to bring the Children<note n="*" place="bottom">And therefore undertake what he can ſafely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and what he cannot, leave to others that may, for life is not to be played with.</note> alive:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:171433:121"/>
He muſt deliver poor Women <hi>gratis,</hi> and treat them as tenderly and with as much humanity as the Rich, extorting nothing from them, but be content with reaſonable ſatisfaction, as they are willing and able to give, and not uſe them like a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Arab,</hi> as ſome do, who aſſoon as they have done their work, whether well or ill, will be paid without delay, and that with ſo much ill manners and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, that they force the poor people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to borrow the money, when they have not enough to ſatisfie their deſires, and take from them to the laſt Penny, to ſatisfie their tyrannical ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice: which proceedings are very unworthy an honeſt man.</p>
               <p>In fine, a Chirurgeon indued with all theſe good qualities muſt be for his accompliſhment and intire perfection, very knowing and expert in his Art, and chiefly in theſe Operations.</p>
               <p>There are many who believe it an eaſie matter to deliver a Woman, becauſe Women uſually practiſe it. In effect, there is no great myſtery, when all things come right and well: But when they come wrong and contrary to Nature, it is moſt certain that it is the moſt difficult and laborious of all Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgical Operations, as is well known to ſuch as practiſe it. It is very good to conſider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it; for in all others, for which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is had to a Chirurgeon, the ſingle life of the Patient only is under his care; but in Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, there is the Mothers, and one Childs life at leaſt, and ſometimes more at ſtake: And it hath been often ſeen, that one ſingle fault in this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath cauſed many diſorders at one time; ſo that one may ſay very juſtly touching delivering of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:171433:121"/>
Women in wrong Labours, <hi>Hoc opus, hic labor eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Chirurgeon qualified as aboveſaid, who is only fit for the work (to behave himſelf as he ought) muſt make ſome Obſervations before he undertakes it; firſt, whether the Woman hath ſtrength enough to endure the Operation, which he may gueſs by the Pulſe, if ſtrong or weak, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal or intermittent: Whether her Face and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her Eyes be dejected, her Speech faint, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of her Body cold; Whether ſhe often faints away with cold Sweats, hath Convulſions with loſs of ſence; in ſhort, If every circumſtance perſwades that the Operation would be in vain, 'tis better to let it alone, than ſhe ſhould dye under his hand, and he be blamed for it, and incur the name of Butcher, as is moſt certain when ſuch a misfortune happens: however if there be any hope, though never ſo little, either for Mother or Child, we are obliged in Conſcience to do what Art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and not as ſome Politicians, who will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer a poor Woman to dye without aſſiſtance, than undertake a doubtful Operation. Wherefore 'tis better to attempt an Operation of an incertain conſequence, than to abandon the Sick to a certain deſpair,<note n="*" place="margin">A ſufficient juſtification for conſcientious Practiſers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the malignant tongues of the ignorant.</note> for ſometimes Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers beyond hope; but before the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon undertakes it, let him give his Prognoſtick of the great danger of death, both Woman and Child is in, which he muſt acquaint the Husband and Friends with, and the Woman her ſelf, if he thinks that ſhe is able to bear it, that ſo ſhe may
<pb n="06" facs="tcp:171433:122"/>
receive the Sacrament before the Operation, leſt ſhe be not capable of it afterwards; becauſe of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriouſneſs of the Operation, in which ſhe may poſſibly dye; as it hath ſometimes happened; but when the Woman hath ſtrength enough, the Chirurgeon muſt not delay his help, for fear it abate, or be totally diſſipated. To which purpoſe, being well aſſured of her ſtrength, he muſt enquire of the Woman, her Midwife and Friends, Whether ſhe be at her full time; or hath received any hurt, which he may alſo perceive by the Signs, obſerving in what poſture the Child preſents, &amp; what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Whether alive or dead; and but one or more? all which being examined, he muſt try to perſwade the Woman of the impoſſibility of her being delivered without his help; and to reſolve to put her ſelf into his hands, which he may do by fair words without frighting of her, perſwading her that the Operation is nothing ſo painful as ſhe may imagine, and in fine that for Gods ſake, her own, and the Childs, ſhe is obliged to ſuffer it, for elſe ſhe and her Child may both periſh</p>
               <p>The Woman being thus reſolved, he muſt place her croſs the Bed, that he may operate the eaſier, ſhe muſt lie on her Back, with her Hips raiſed a little higher than her Head, or at leaſt the Body equally placed, when it is neceſſary to put back or turn the Infant, to give it a better poſture; but if he reſolves to draw it forth, he muſt place the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo as we have directed in the natural Labour, which is with her Head and Breaſt a little elevated above the reſt of her Body, that ſhe may fetch her breath with more facility, and help to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Infant by bearing down, when the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:171433:122"/>
Chirurgeon bids her. Being thus ſcituated, ſhe muſt fold her Legs ſo as her Heels be towards her Buttocks, and her Thighs ſpread, and held ſo by a couple of ſtrong perſons. There muſt be likewiſe others to ſupport her under her Arms, that her Body may not ſlide down, when the Child is drawn forth, for which ſometimes a great ſtrength is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; the Sheet and Blankets muſt cover her Thighs for decency ſake, in reſpect of the Aſſiſtants, and alſo to prevent her catching cold, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon herein governing himſelf as well with reſpect to his own convenience, the facility and ſurety of his Operation, as to theſe things.</p>
               <p>Some would have the Woman bound in this poſture, that (as they ſay) ſhe being more firm and ſtable, the work may be done with greater certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but ſuch Ligatures are ſo far from that, that on the contrary they are very prejudicial; for the Woman being ſo fixed, and conſtrained as on a Rack, ſhe cannot raiſe her ſelf, nor ſlide down, or be lifted up, when the Chirurgeon finds occaſion for it, to render his Operation leſs difficult, which uſually he doth by partly putting back, partly drawing forth, ſometimes directly, ſometimes obliquely, for which reaſon her Body ought to be at liberty, only held in a poſture convenient to theſe ſeveral intentions by her Friends, according to his directions: but if ſhe muſt needs be bound, let it be with good reaſons to perſwade her patiently to endure her Labour, and to contribute her whole ſtrength to the Operation, promiſing her the ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Delivery poſſible.</p>
               <p>Let the Chirurgeon then anoint the entrance of the Womb with Oyl or freſh Butter, if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:171433:123"/>
that ſo he may with more eaſe introduce his hand, which muſt likewiſe be anointed, having the conditions above ſpecified: after which he muſt manage his Operations after the manner I ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect in each of the following Chapters, having firſt recited the marks by which may be known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Child be alive or dead.</p>

               <p>IF there be any Caſe, wherein a Chirurgeon ought to make the greateſt reflection, and uſe moſt precaution in his Art, it is this,<note n="*" place="margin">This is not ſo neceſſary to thoſe Practitioners which can fetch a Child coming right, or with the arm, without hooks or ſharp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, as the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of this Book and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Brother can.</note> to know whether the Infant in the Womb be alive or dead; for there have been many deplorable examples of Children being drawn forth alive, after they have been thought to be dead, with both Arms or ſome other Limb lopt off, and others miſerably killed by the uſe of Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets, which might have been born alive, if they had not been miſtaken. Wherefore before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves on the manner of laying the Woman, to avoid the like misfortune, and the diſgrace of being au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:171433:123"/>
of ſuch a pittiful ſpectacle, let him do his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavour not to be ſo deceived, and to be fully ſatisfied, whether the Child be alive or dead; alwaies remembring that in this caſe timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity is more pardonable than temerity; that is, it is better to be deceived in treating a dead Infant, as if it were alive; than a living one, as if it were dead.</p>
               <p>The Child may be known to be alive, if it be at the full reckoning; if the Woman hath received no hurt; if ſhe hath had her health well all her going with Child; if ſhe be at that preſent in good health, and very ſure if ſhe feels it ſtir, which may be known by the Mothers relation: and the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon may be better aſſured of it, if he feels it ſtir himſelf, laying his Hand on the Mothers Belly, to whoſe relation he muſt not alwaies truſt; for I have ſometimes delivered Women, whoſe Children had been dead above four days (as may eaſily be judged by their corruption) who notwithſtanding affirmed (although untruly) that they felt them ſtir but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before they were delivered; and others again, who were alive, yet they never perceived them to ſtir in <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> days before, as they confeſſed. If the Chirurgeon cannot be aſſured by the Infants motion that it is alive, he may, aſſoon as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are broke, gently put up his hand into the Womb, to feel the pulſation of the Navel-ſtring, which he will find ſtronger the nearer he feels it to the Infants Belly; or if he meets with a Hand, he may feel the Pulſe, but their Pulſation is not ſo ſtrong as the Navelſtrings, by which it is beſt to be known: if then he finds thus the beating of the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:171433:124"/>
Pulſe, he may be confident the Child is alive; as alſo if by putting his Finger into its Mouth, he perceives it to ſtir its Tongue, as if it would ſuck.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary the Child is dead, if it hath not a long time ſtirred; if there flowes from the Womb ſtinking and cadaverous humours; if the Woman feels great pains, and a great weight in her Belly; if it be not ſupported, but tumbles alwaies on that ſide as ſhe layes her ſelf: if ſhe ſaints<note n="*" place="margin">Not alwaies a ſign.</note> or hath Convuſions; if the Navel-ſtring or <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> hath been a good while in the world; or if by putting his Hand into the Womb, he finds the Child cold, and the Navel-ſtring without Pulſe, and its Tongue immoveable; and feeling the Head he finds it very ſoft, chiefly towards the Crown, where likewiſe the Bones are open, and riding the one upon the other at the <hi>Sutures,</hi> becauſe the Brains ſhrink, and are without Pulſe when the Child is dead; which corrupts more in two days in the Womb than it doth in four after it is born; which the Heat and Moiſtneſs of the place cauſeth, the two principles of Corruption.</p>
               <p>But one may only conjecture it, if the Woman hath been hurt, or floods much, &amp; be not at her full time; if her Waters broke four or five days before; if her Breaſts flag; if her Complexion be of a lead colour, her Countenance languiſhing and dejected, and if her Breath ſtinks. We ſay that theſe things may only make us conjecture it, but not, as the reſt, certainly conclude it; many of which happening to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one perſon, aſſures us that the Child is dead, for want of which it cannot be very certain;

               <p>I have already ſhewed in the <hi>Ninth</hi> Chapter of this Book, how a Woman muſt be delivered in a natural Labour, where you may find the means; but ſometimes the Midwife by endeavouring it, breaks the String with pulling too ſtrongly, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is very weak; or elſe ſo putrified when the Child is dead, that the leaſt pull breaks it off cloſe at the Burthen, which by that means is left behind
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:171433:125"/>
in the Womb, or becauſe it cleaves too ſtrongly, or the Woman is weak and cannot expel it, being much tired by a long Labour; or becauſe it was not ſpeedily after Labour drawn forth, the Womb clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſo, as leaves it no paſſage, nor can it without much difficulty be again dilated to have it fetch'd, becauſe it remains dry, after the natural ſlime and humidities, which uſually flow in Labours, are ſometimes paſt.</p>
               <p>Since it is a verity indubitable, that the Afterbirth remaining behind after the Child is born, becomes an uſeleſs Corps, capable of deſtroying the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, we muſt take care that it be never left, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Wherefore having endeavoured to bring it away, as we have directed in the aforenamed Chapter, and the Navel-ſtring happen to break near the Burthen, you muſt immediately, before the Womb cloſeth, introduce your Hand into it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well anointed with Oyl or freſh Butter, your Nails cloſe pared, for to ſeparate it from the Womb gently, and draw it forth together with the Clods of Blood that are there. When the Navel-ſtring is not broken, it will eaſily conduct the Hand by following of it to the place, where the Burthen is ſcituated; but when it is broken, we have no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger this guide, wherefore you muſt be then very careful, that you be not deceived in taking one part for another; as I once ſaw a Midwife pull the Womb near the inward Orifice, inſtead of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then which was behind: but when ſhe perceived all her endeavours vain, except it were to make the poor Woman to ſuffer extremely, ſhe yeelded her up to me, confeſſing her incapacity, although ſhe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:171433:125"/>
had vaunted<note n="*" place="bottom">It ſeems Midwives in other Countries, as well as ſome in <hi>England,</hi> have that dangerous vanity.</note> before, that ſhe was more capable in her Art than any Chirurgeon.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon then as you have introduced your Hand into the Womb towards its Fund, or bottom, you will find the Burthen; which you may know by a great number of little inequalities, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made there by the roots of the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Veſſels, on the ſide where they terminate, which makes it to be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the Womb; if it yet cleave to it, notwithſtanding that it is then a little wrinkled and uneven; becauſe its Membranes, which were very much enlarged, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract themſelves immediatly after the Child and its Waters which kept them extended, are excluded:<note n="*" place="margin">Be careful of thoſe that are not.</note> but they that are expert in this Art can eaſily judge of it. If you find the Burthen wholly looſened from the Womb, it will not be difficult to draw it forth, when you have got it in your Hand: but if it cleaves, finding the ſide where it ſticks leaſt, begin there to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it gently, by putting ſome of your Fingers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Womb, continuing by little and little to do ſo, till it be quite looſe, and afterwards to draw it forth very carefully; obſerving the whilſt (if it cannot be otherwiſe) rather to leave ſome part of it behind, than to ſcrape or ſcratch the leaſt part of the Womb, for fear of a flooding, inflammation, or Gangrene, which cauſe death:
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:171433:126"/>
being alſo careful not to draw it forth till it be wholly or the moſt part of it ſeparated, for fear of drawing forth the Womb with it, and preſerving it as whole as theſe reflections will permit, becauſe of ſhewing it to the company, that they know the Operation is well done.</p>
               <p>When the Chirurgeon finds not the Womb open enough for to direct his hand immediatly into it, let him<note n="*" place="margin">Danger in delays.</note> preſently anoint all the Womans Privities with Hogs-greaſe, that they may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with more eaſe, afterwards let him by little and little put up his Hand, but without much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: the Woman may likewiſe contribute to this dilatation, as alſo to the excluſion of the Burthen, if ſhe bears ſtrongly down, holding her Breath, and exciting her ſelf to vomit, or ſneeze, and do thoſe other things directed in the above mentioned Chapter; but if notwithſtanding all this ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not void the Afterbirth, and if the Womb cannot be dilated enough to fetch it, or that it cleaves ſo faſt, as it cannot be ſeparated, then to avoid a greater miſchief, we muſt leave it to Nature, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with remedies, which ſuppurates; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Injections into the Womb are proper, made of <hi>Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Pellitory,</hi> and <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed,</hi> in which is mixed a good quantity of Oyl of <hi>Lillies,</hi> or freſh Butter. This injection ſoftens and tempers, and by moiſtning and mollifying, makes the Orifice to be the eaſier dilated, and helps by Suppuration the looſenings of the Burthen. And to haſten the expulſion of it, give her a ſtrong Clyſter, that ſo, by the motions to go to Stool, it
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:171433:126"/>
may cauſe it to be voided, as it hath arrived to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that have rendered it in the Bed-pan, and ſometimes when they have leaſt expected it.</p>
               <p>One may at the ſame time, to prevent a Fever and many other accidents which uſually happen, bleed her in the Arm, or Foot, according as it may be neceſſary and convenient, and ſtrengthen her, that the <hi>Foetus</hi> and cadaverous Vapours, coming from the putrifaction of the Burthen, aſcend not to the Noble parts, which may be done by good Cordials often uſed, not ſuch as are made of <hi>Theriacle, Mithridate,</hi> or the like, for which no reaſon can be given, but their ſpecifick or rather imaginary Faculties, and are fitter to cauſe Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting than comfort the Heart: but true Cordials are ſuch as yeeld good nouriſhment, and at the ſame time comfort the Stomach, without nauſeating it, as thoſe Drugs do which are only good for them that ſell them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let her have good Broaths and Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; ſhe may drink <hi>Limonade</hi> or <hi>Orengade,</hi> or have in her <hi>Ptiſan</hi> Syrup of <hi>Limons</hi> or <hi>Pomgranats,</hi> or from time to time (if ſhe be weak and free from a Fever) a little Wine and Water mixed, which we ſay is the beſt, (<hi>in ſome caſes, but not alwaies</hi>) and moſt natural of all Cordials; beſides other Remedies may be provided, according to the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which happen, by reaſon of the ſtaying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind of the Burthen, always endeavouring to bring it away aſſoon as poſſible, for as long as it ſtays in the Womb, the Woman feels continually great Pains, almoſt like to them before her Child was born, although there remained but a ſmall piece of it, and until the whole be voided, the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:171433:127"/>
Pains will ſtill be repeated, although in vain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the matter be well diſpoſed before; but the leſſer the piece is of the Burthen retained, the more difficult it is ſometimes to be expelled; becauſe the impulſes, which the Woman can make by helping her Throwes, are not ſo great, when the matter contained in the Womb is ſmall, as when it is of a conſiderable bigneſs; for then it is more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thruſt and compreſſed: which is the reaſon why a Woman miſcarries with greater difficulty, than when brought to Bed at her full time.</p>
               <p>There are many Midwives, who having bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Navel-ſtring, as<note n="*" place="margin">This may happen to a good Midwife, but the fault is when they do not diſcover it, that ſeaſonable help may be applied.</note> aboveſaid, leave their work imperfect, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the reſt to Natures work; but very often the poor Woman dies, becauſe of the great miſchiefs which happen uſually before the ſuppuration of the Burthen ſo retained: To avoid which, aſſoon as they meet with the like caſe, they muſt endeavour to fetch it, according as we have directed; or if they find themſelves not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do it, becauſe the Hand muſt be put up into the Womb, which is more properly the work of a Chirurgeon expert in thoſe caſes, let them preſently ſend for one, that ſo he may be yet able, before the Womb cloſeth, to introduce his hand; for the longer it is deferred, the more difficult will be the work.</p>
               <p>There are other Midwives bold enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this Operation, but for want of induſtry or neceſſary knowledg they cannot effect it, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:171433:127"/>
leave the Woman oftentimes in a worſe condition than if they had never medled with it; as happened about a year or little more ſince to a poor Woman in the <hi>Fauxbourgh S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Marcel,</hi> whom I helped three days after ſhe was delivered; being half gone, by a Midwife of the ſame <hi>Fauxbourgh,</hi> at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Mr. <hi>Beſſier</hi> a Chirurgeon and my good Friend, who conducted and accompanied me to her, where I found her in continual pain all over her Belly, which held her like throws of another Travail, voiding black humours extremely ſtinking and offenſive, with which ſhe had alſo a great pain in her Head, and a Fever, which in a ſhort time would without doubt have augmented, if I had not preſently fetched what remained: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having enquired of the perſons preſent in her Chamber, how ſhe was delivered, and when; they told me not yet three whole days, but that the Midwife not being able to fetch all, did only bring away ſome ſmall pieces of the Burthen, &amp; told them,<note n="*" place="margin">An excuſe of ſome of our Midwives.</note> that they need not be troubled at what remained, perſwading them alwaies that it would come away of it ſelf, and that nothing more was to be done but patience. Truly ſhe was not ſo much to be blamed, for not having delivered this Woman, as ſhe was in not acquainting her that ſhe needed more help, when ſhe found that it was beyond her skill.</p>
               <p>After this information, having put up two of my Fingers into the <hi>Vagina,</hi> to underſtand the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate of things, I found the inward orifice of her Womb almoſt quite cloſed, into which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I got my Fore-finger, where by moving it to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:171433:128"/>
and again without taking it away, by little and little I dilated her Orifice, ſo as to introduce an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Finger, with which two alone, being not able to get in the reſt, I brought away three pieces of the Afterbirth, of the bigneſs of a Walnut, which were left behind, taking them one after the other with my two fingers, as Crabs do when they gripe any thing with one of their forked Claws; by which means in a ſmall time I delivered this Woman quite, who immediatly after felt no more pain, and recovered ſoon after: but otherwiſe ſhe had certainly been in danger of her life, becauſe of the great corruption of what was left behind in the Womb: for that which I fetcht away, ſmelt ſo ill, that my Hands ſtank of it above two days after, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I waſhed them three or four times with Vinegar.</p>
               <p>This Chapter may ſuffice to ſhow how one ſhould behave himſelf in this Caſe. We will now teach what is fit to be done in each of the other Labours againſt Nature.</p>

               <p>Moſt Authors adviſe in this caſe to change the Figure, and place the Head ſo, as it may preſent firſt to the Birth; but if they would ſhow, how it ſhould be done, we might follow their counſel, which is very difficult, if not altogether impoſſible to be performed, if we deſire to avoid the dangers that by ſuch violent endeavors the Mother and Child muſt neceſſarily be put in; wherefore 'tis better to draw it forth by the Feet, when it comes Footling, than to venture a worſe accident by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">That is, aſſoon as the Waters are broke.</note> Aſſoon then as 'tis known the Child comes thus, and the Womb is open enough to admit the Chirurgeons hand into it, or elſe by anointing the Paſſages with Oyl or Hogs greaſe, to endeavour to dilate it by little and little, uſing to this purpoſe his Fingers, ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them one from the other after they are together entred, and continuing ſo to do, 'till it be ſufficiently dilated; then, having his Nails well pared, and no Rings on his Fingers, his Hands well anointed with Oyl or freſh Butter, as alſo the Woman placed after the manner as we have already often directed, let him gently introduce his Hand into the entry of the Womb, where finding the Childs
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:171433:130"/>
Feet, let him draw it forth in that poſture we ſhall now direct: but if it preſents but one Foot, he ſhould conſider, whether the right or left, and in what faſhion it comes; for theſe reflexions will eaſily inform him, on what ſide the other may be; which aſſoon as he knows, let him ſeek it, and gently draw it forth together with the firſt, but let him alſo be very careful that this ſecond be not the Foot of another Child; for if ſo, he may ſooner ſplit both Mother and Children then draw them forth; which may eaſily be prevented, if having ſlid his hand up the firſt Leg and Thigh to the Twiſt, he finds both Thighs joined together, and depending from one and the ſame Body; which is likewiſe the beſt means to find the other Foot, when it comes but with one.</p>
               <p>All Authors, for fear of loſing hold of the firſt Foot, adviſe to faſten a Ribban to it with a running knot, that ſo it may not be ſought a ſecond time, when the other is found: but that is not abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe uſually when one hath hold of one,<note n="*" place="margin">Not alwaies.</note> the other is not far off: they that will may uſe this precaution; but ſuch as are expert, uſe it but ſeldom.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon then as the Chirurgeon hath found both the Childs feet, he may draw them forth; holding them together, he may bring them by little and little in this manner, taking afterwards hold of the Legs and Thighs aſſoon as he can come at them; and drawing them ſo till the Hips be come forth: the whilſt let him obſerve to wrap the parts in a ſingle Napkin, to the end that his Hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already greaſy, ſlide not on the Infants body,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:171433:130"/>
which is very ſlippery, becauſe of the viſcous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which are all over it, and hinder that one cannot take good hold of it, which being done, he may take hold under the Hips to draw it ſo forth, to the beginning of the Breaſt, and then let him on both ſides with his hand bring down the Arms along the Childs body, which he may then eaſily find, and be careful that the Belly and Face be down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, leſt being upwards, the Head be ſtopt by the Chin over the Share-bone; wherefore if it be not ſo, he muſt turn it to that Poſture; which is eaſily done, if taking hold on the body, when the Breaſt and Arms are forth in the manner we have ſaid, he draws it, with turning it in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on that ſide which it moſt inclines to, till it be as it ſhould be, that is, with the Face downwards, and having brought it to the Shoulders, let him loſe no time, (deſiring the Woman at the ſame time to bear down) that ſo in drawing, the Head at that inſtant may take its place, and not be ſtopt in the paſſage. Some Authors, to prevent this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, adviſe that one Arm only ſhould be drawn forth, and the other left to prevent the cloſing of the Womb on the Neck of the Child: this reaſon is plauſible, yet if the Chirurgeon knows how to catch his opportunity, he will not need this ſhift to prevent this accident, which may ſooner happen when one Arm is left above; for beſides that by its bigneſs it would take up ſo much place, which is already too little, cauſing the Head to lean more on one ſide than the other, it will ſtop it certainly on that ſide where there is no Arm; and when I have ſometimes tryed to deliver a Woman, leaving one of the Arms above with the Head, I could not
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:171433:131"/>
till I fetched both Arms, and then I finiſhed my operation with more eaſe.</p>
               <p>There are indeed ſome Children that have their Head ſo big, that when the whole Body is born, yet that ſtops in the Paſſage, notwithſtanding all the care to prevent it: in this caſe he muſt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour only to draw forth the Child by the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, leſt he ſometimes ſeparates the Body from the Head, but he muſt diſengage it, by little and little, from the bones in the Paſſage with the fingers of each Hand, ſliding them on each ſide oppoſite the one to the other, ſometimes above and ſometimes under, until the work be ended, endeavouring to diſpatch it aſſoon as poſſible, leſt the Child be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated; as it will certainly be, if he ſhould remain long in that Poſture, which being well and duly effected, he may ſoon after fetch the After-birth as above directed.</p>

               <p>NOtwithſtanding all the care poſſible had in the fetching a Child by the Feet, yet ſometimes one meets them ſo putrified and corrupted, that with the leaſt pull the Body ſeparates from the Head, which remains alone in the Womb, and cannot be extracted but with much difficulty, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it is extremely ſlippery, by reaſon of the place where it is, and of a round Figure, on which no hold can be taken. The difficulty uſually met with upon the like occaſion hath been ſo great, that ſometimes two or three Chirurgeons one after the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:171433:131"/>
other have forſaken the Operation, not being able to accompliſh it, after all their induſtry in vain employed, together with their ſtrength, ſo that neceſſarily the death of the Woman enſued: but I am of opinion they had eſcaped this misfortune, if they had done what I ſhall now direct.</p>
               <p>When then the Infants Head, ſeparated from its Body, remains alone behind, whether becauſe of putrifaction or otherwiſe, let the Chirurgeon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly without delay, whilſt the Womb is yet open, direct up his right Hand to find the Mouth of this Head (for there is then no other hold) and having found it, let him put one or two of his Fingers into it, and his Thumb under the Chin, and then by little and little let him draw it, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſo by the Jaw; but if that fails, as it often will when putrified, then let him pull forth his right Hand and ſlide up his left, with which he muſt ſupport the Head, and with the right let him take a narrow Crochet, but ſtrong and with a ſingle branch, which he muſt guide along the inſide of his other Hand, keeping the point of it towards it, for fear of hurting the Womb, and having thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced it, let him turn it towards the Head, for to ſtrike it into either an Eye-hole or the hole of an Ear, or behind the Head, or els between the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as he finds it moſt eaſie and convenient, and then draw forth the Head ſo faſtened with the Crochet, ſtill helping to conduct it with his left Hand, but when he hath brought it near the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, being ſtrongly faſtened to the Crochet, (as is already directed in one of the mentioned places) let him remember to draw forth his Hand, that the Paſſage being not filled with it may be the larger
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:171433:132"/>
and eaſier, keeping ſtill a Finger or two on the ſide of the Head, the better to diſengage it.</p>
               <p>You may try for the ſame purpoſe an<note n="*" place="margin">Doubtful expedient.</note> expedient (which appears to me very ingenious) and (thinking on this ſubject) came lately into my mind, by which, without doubt, one may effect this painful and laborious Operation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tormenting the Woman ſo much as ſhe is, when either the Crochet or crooked Knife are uſed; which is a ſoft Fillet, or linnen ſlip, of the breadth of four Fingers, and the length of three quarters of an Ell or thereabouts, and taking the two ends with the left Hand, and the middle with the right, let him ſo put it up with his right, as that it may be beyond the Head to embrace it, as a ſling doth a ſtone, and afterwards drawing the fillet by the two ends together, it will eaſily be drawn forth, the fillet not hindering in the leaſt the paſſage, becauſe it takes up little or no place.</p>
               <p>But if the Chirurgeon cannot by either of theſe different means draw forth the Head, becauſe 'tis too big, he will be neceſſitated (if he will finiſh his work) to leſſen it with a crooked knife, marked D. in the repreſentations of the inſtruments, at the end of the <hi>Second</hi> Book. For to do this, let him ſlide up his left hand into the Womb, and with his right guide up the Knife, always obſerving that the point be turned towards the inſide of the left hand, for fear of hurting the Womb, and afterwards let him turn<note n="*" place="bottom">A dangerous Operation, not raſhly to be undertaken.</note> it to the <hi>Sutures</hi> of the Head, and chiefly
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:171433:132"/>
the Crown, where he muſt make the inciſion with this Inſtrument, that having ſeparated ſome pieces, he may the eaſier draw forth the Head, or at leaſt having emptyed ſome part of the Brain, by the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſo made, the bigneſs of the Head will be much diminiſhed by it, and conſequently the extraction of it leſs painful.</p>
               <p>The left hand being thus in the Womb, will be very uſefull to help ſtrike the knife into the Head, for to divide and ſeparate its parts, as the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon judges neceſſary, as alſo to hinder that by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertancy the Womb receive no hurt; and the right without, for to hold the handle of this inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which therefore muſt be long enough, and will ſerve him to move and guide it on which ſide he pleaſeth; in turning, thruſting, drawing, or ſlant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as the caſe requires. <hi>Ambroſe Parè</hi> and <hi>Guillemeau</hi> would have this Knife to be ſo ſhort, as to be hid in the right Hand, for to do the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after it is ſo introduced into the Womb; but it is certain, that when it is filled with a monſtrous Child, or a Head, as aboveſaid, the Chirurgeons hand will be ſo preſſed in the Womb, that it will be very difficult for him to uſe it skilfully with one Hand alone, and do no violence to the Womb; which is the reaſon why (if I may be credited) this inſtrument ought to have a long Handle, that being introduced the Womb, it may be conducted to do the Operation with the left Hand within, as we have mentioned, and governed by the right which holds the Handle of it without, which ought to be as long as the handle of an ordinary Crochet. They that will take the pains to conceive my Arguments, and try this Inſtrument when they have occaſion,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:171433:133"/>
will confeſs it to be much more uſeful and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, being thus long, than ſo ſhort as the ſaid <hi>Parè</hi> and <hi>Guillemeau</hi> recomend. For my part, having cauſed one to be made of that faſhion, I found it very convenient when I had the like occaſion to uſe it.</p>
               <p>Now when the Head is thus fetcht out of the Womb, care muſt be taken, that not the leaſt part of it be left behind, as alſo to cleanſe the Woman well of her After-birth, if yet remaining. But a queſtion of great conſequence and much to the purpoſe may be here ſtarted, Whether the Childs Head yet remaining ſo in the Womb, and the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then alſo, the Head ought to be extracted before the Burthen; to which may be anſwered with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that if the Burthen be wholly ſeparated from the ſides of the Womb, it ought to be firſt brought away; becauſe it may hinder the taking hold of the Head, but if it be ſtill adhering, it muſt not be medled with, till the Head be brought away; for if one ſhould then go about to ſeparate it from the Womb, it would cauſe a flooding, which would be augmented by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Operation; for the Veſſels to which it is joined, remain for the moſt part open, as long as the Womb is diſtended, which the Head cauſeth whilſt it is retained in it, and cannot cloſe till this ſtrange body be voided, and then it doth by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting and compreſſing it ſelf together, as I have heretofore more exactly explained: beſides, the Afterbirth remaining thus cleaving to the Womb, during the Operation, prevents it from receiving eaſily either bruiſe or hurt.

               <p>Women troubled with a bearing down of the Womb before they conceive, and whoſe Womb is very moiſt, are much ſubject to this accident; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the relaxation of the Ligaments. The ſame Method we have taught in the natural Travail muſt not now be obſerved; for in this caſe the Woman muſt neither walk, nor ſtand upright; but keep her Bed, with her body equally at leaſt ſcituated, and not raiſed a little, as is requiſite in a natural Labour: She muſt by no means uſe ſtrong or ſharp Clyſters, leſt they excite too great Throws, neither ſo much humect the Womb, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too much relaxed: but to aid her at the moment each Pain takes her, when the Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to advance his Head, and conſequently the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:171433:134"/>
Neck of the Womb, let the Midwife keep her hands on each ſide of the Head, to thruſt back, by reſiſting the Womans pains, the Womb only, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way in the mean time for the Child to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, doing the like at every Throw, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it till the Woman of her ſelf hath forced the Child quite into the world: for one muſt by no means draw it by the Head, as is mentioned in the natural Labour, for fear of cauſing the Womb to fall out at the ſame time, to which it is then very apt.</p>
               <p>If notwithſtanding the Infant having the Head born, and yet ſtops there ſo long as to indanger its ſuffocation, then the Midwife muſt call a ſecond perſon to her aſſiſtance, to draw it gently forth by the Head, whilſt ſhe keeps back the Womb with both her Hands, to prevent its following the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants body ſo drawn forth. After the Woman is thus delivered, her Afterbirth muſt be fetched as is above directed, being ſtill careful for the ſame reaſon not to ſhake or draw it forth too rudely, and then let it be placed up in its natural ſcituation, if it bears down.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> How to fetch a Child, when coming right it cannot paſs, either becauſe it is too big, or the Paſſages cannot be ſufficiently dilated.</head>
               <p>THere are ſome Women, whoſe Children (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they come right) remain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four, five, and ſix whole days in the Paſſage, and would continue there longer, if they were left alone, without being able to be born, unleſs aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Art; to which we are obliged, if we deſire to ſave the Mothers life: this happens ofteneſt to little Women of their firſt Children, and chiefly if a little too much in years; becauſe their Womb being very dry, cannot be ſo eaſily dilated, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who already have had Children, or are not ſo old. When this happens, after that the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon hath done his endeavour to relax and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the parts, for to facilitate the Childs birth, and that he finds all in vain, becauſe the Head is much bigger than it ſhould be, and that beſides, it is certainly dead (as it for the moſt part is, when it hath continued four or five days in this condition, after the Waters are broke) which he may be more exactly aſſured of by the ſigns already deſcribed in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of this Book,<note n="*" place="bottom">This may be connived at when the Child is dead, but becauſe the moſt careful may ofttimes be miſtaken, it cannot be approved of, as appears in the Tranſlators Epiſtle to the Reader.</note> he need then
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:171433:135"/>
make no ſcruple to faſten a Crochet to ſome part of the Childs head, and rather about the hinder part than any other, for to draw it forth by this means directly, if poſſible; if not, let him make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion with a ſtrait or little crooked Knife, which is beſt, about the <hi>Sutures,</hi> for to empty thence ſome of the Brains, and ſo leſſen the bigneſs of this Head, and immediatly after fix his Crochet faſt to the Skull in the ſame place, whereby he will eaſily extract the Infant.</p>
               <p>It is very certain when the Child is dead, one ought to do according to my direction, to ſave the Mothers life: but it is a very great<note n="*" place="margin">This queſtion is out of doors, for the reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the foreſaid Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</note> queſtion, Whether a live Child ought to be ſo dealt with to ſave the Mothers life, after there is no more hopes that it can be born any otherwayes, becauſe of the narrowneſs of the Paſſage, which cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be ſufficiently dilated for its Birth; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one ought to defer the Operation, untill there is a perfect aſſurance that 'tis dead? In this caſe I am apt to believe, that, ſince the Infant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid death neither one way nor the other, (for ſtaying in the Paſſage, without being able to be born, it muſt dye, and being drawn forth by Crochets, it is killed) one muſt and ought fetch it out alive or dead, aſſoon as there is opportunity to do it, and when all hope is loſt that it can come any otherways, thereby to prevent the Mothers death, which could by no other means be avoided. <hi>Tertullian</hi> (as <hi>Riolanus</hi> very well notes in his 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of his <hi>Anatomical</hi>

               <p>WHen the Child preſents the ſide of the Head, though it ſeems a natural Labour, becauſe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:171433:137"/>
the Head comes firſt, yet 'tis very dangerous both to Child and Mother, for he ſhall ſooner break his Neck, than ever be born in that faſhion; and by how much the Mothers pains continue to bear him, which is impoſſible unleſs the Head be firſt right placed, the more the Paſſages are ſtopt up.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">A good Note, for though ſome poſſibly, not unlike this Birth may in time be born, yet 'tis for the moſt part dangerous delaying it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many Children and ſome Women have been ſo loſt.</note>Therefore aſſoon as it is known, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt be laid with all ſpeed, leſt the Child advancing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this vicious Poſture, it prove more difficult to thruſt him back, which muſt be done when we would place the Head right in the Paſſage, as it truly and naturally ſhould be.</p>
               <p>For to effect this, place the Woman that her Hips be a little higher than her Head and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, cauſing her to lean a little upon the oppoſite ſide to the Childs ill poſture, then let the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon ſlide up his Hand, well anointed with Oyl, by the ſide of the Childs head, for to bring it right, gently with his Fingers between the Head and the Womb; but if the Head be ſo engaged that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eaſily done that way, he muſt then put his Hand up to its Shoulders, that ſo by thruſting them back a little in the Womb, ſometimes on the one ſide, and ſometimes the other, as he ſees oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, he may give it a natural and convenient Poſition.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſhed that the Chirurgeon could put back the Infant by the Shoulders with both his
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:171433:137"/>
Hands in this manner; but the Head doth then take up ſo much room, that he hath much ado to introduce but one, with which he muſt do his Operation, with the help of the Fingers ends of the other Hand put up as far as neceſſary, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards let him excite and procure the Childs birth, as directed in the natural Labour.</p>
               <p>At other times a Child comes with the Face firſt, having its Head turned back, in which Poſture it is very difficult it ſhould be born, and if it remain ſo long, the Face will be ſo black and blew, and ſwelled, that at firſt ſight it will appear monſtrous; which comes as well by the compreſſion of it in that place, as by the Midwifes fingers handling it too rudely, when ſhe would place it in a better Poſture.</p>
               <p>I remember about ſix years ago, in the like Caſe, a Woman whoſe Child came with the Face ſo black and miſhapen aſſoon as it was born (as uſually in ſuch caſes) that it lookt like a Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor, however I delivered her of it alive: aſſoon as the Mother ſaw it, ſhe told me, that ſhe always fear'd her Child would be ſo monſtrous; becauſe when ſhe was young with Child of it, ſhe fixed her looks very much upon a Blackmoor belonging to the Duke <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> who alwaies kept ſeveral of them; wherefore ſhe wiſhed, or at leſt cared not though it dyed, rather than to behold a Child ſo disfigured, as it then appeared: But ſhe ſoon changed her mind, when I ſatisfied her that this blackneſs was only becauſe it came Faceling, and that aſſuredly in three or four days it would wear away; as it happened, having often anointed it with Oyl of ſweet Almonds by expreſſion; and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:171433:138"/>
when I ſaw the Child about a year after, me thought I had not ſeen a fairer. Now to deliver this Birth, the ſame manner, as when a Child comes with the ſide of the Head, muſt be obſerved, being careful to work gently, to avoid as much as may be the bruiſing of the Face.</p>

               <p>THe Child comes naturally with the Head firſt, becauſe that by the hardneſs and bigneſs of it, the Paſſage might be the better made and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the other parts of the Body, which uſually paſs afterwards without pain: but notwithſtanding ſometimes the Head is ſo ſmall, and the Shoulders ſo large, that without a very great difficulty, they cannot paſs; which makes the Child remain often in the Paſſage after the Head is born. This acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent may likewiſe happen ſomtimes, for not having been careful to loſe no time to draw forth the Child by the Head, as directed in the Diſcourſe of natural Labours, to the end the Shoulders might at the ſame inſtant ſucceed in the place the Head poſſeſt.</p>

               <p>In the year 1660, whilſt I practiſed Midwifery in that Hoſpital, it happened that the Deputy had a Woman whoſe Child ſhe could not poſſibly bring into the world further than its Head, where it ſo remained, and ſeing ſhe could not after all her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours finiſh the work, ſhe called the Midwife of the place to her aid, which was then Madam <hi>de France,</hi> who likewiſe uſed her utmoſt skill, but in vain, and when they were both thus tired in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:171433:140"/>
pulling the Head (ſo as the <hi>Vertebra's</hi> of the Neck were ſeparated, and that it hung only by a little of the Skin) I came in the <hi>interim,</hi> when they deſired me to examine the buſineſs, and to find the cauſe why the Child could not be drawn forth with all their ſtrengths, which was ſufficient to have drawn forth the Shoulders, if they had been as big again as they were; which having conſidered, I immediatly conceived the difficulty to proceed from ſomething elſe: wherefore I put my hand into the Womb up to the Childs ſhoulders, which ſeemed not too big to paſs with eaſe, therefore I concluded that the hinderance was not there. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I put my hand further up, directing it all along his Breaſt, at the bottom of which, near the griſle <hi>Xiphoïde,</hi> I found his Belly hydropical and full of Water, ſo that it was impoſſible ever to deliver the Woman, until the Water was emptied by piercing the Belly: but there wanting a fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for the purpoſe, I immediatly ſent to advertiſe one of the Chirurgeons of the ſame Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, to whom I declared the caſe as I found it, adding withal that the Child could not be born, unleſs an orifice was made to empty the Belly: but he would by no means follow my opinion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was out of policy, believing it may be, that he very well underſtood his buſineſs without needing my advice, or that he would not or could not believe the Child to be hydropical, as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him; wherefore he contented himſelf, without an exact examination of the caſe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour only the extraction of it after his manner; and, to effect it, he immediatly pulled and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the Head wholy from the Body, which hung
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:171433:140"/>
then but by a skin; becauſe the Midwives, as I ſaid before, had pulled it with ſo much violence. Afterwards with his Crochets he pull'd away both the Arms, and ſome of the Ribs, part of the Lungs and the Heart, one piece after another for above three quarters of an hour, that he was very wet with Sweat, although it were cold weather; and having thus tired both his mind and body, he was conſtrained to quit the work, to reſt a while, leaving the Midwife to endeavour what ſhe could the whilſt, who wearied her ſelf alſo in vain, as well as he had done, by pulling ſome of the Childs Ribs with her hands only (<note n="*" place="margin">Though ſome here in <hi>England</hi> blindly adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the uſe of them, to the loſs of many lives, which cannot be approved, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators Epiſtle to the Reader.</note> for it is not a Midwifes work to uſe Crochets.) After this he returns the ſecond time with all his ſtrength to the work, without effecting any more, becauſe he had not yet opened the lower bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> nor would not, as I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him every moment, without which it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impoſſible to draw forth the reſt of the Body.</p>
               <p>When he ſaw that his ſecond endeavors were as ineffectual as his firſt, he gave me at length his Crochet, telling me that I might weary my ſelf as well as the others, which I willingly and with joy accepted (for I was very certain I could finiſh the operation) knowing very well, that inſtead of amuſing my ſelf as they had done, about pulling of it, I ought only to pierce the Infants belly to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:171433:141"/>
let out the Waters, after which all the reſt would very eaſily follow. For which purpoſe I put up my left Hand into the Womb, juſt to the right ſide of the ſwelled Belly, and then with my right Hand I guided the Crochet (like to that marked <hi>A,</hi> amongſt the repreſentation of the Inſtruments at the end of this <hi>Second</hi> Book, inſtead of which it were better to uſe the crooked Knife, marked there <hi>D</hi>) along my left hand into the Womb, and then I turned the point of it towards the Infants Belly, in which I ſtruck it, ſo that I made a hole big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to receive two of my Fingers ends, (which I put into it after it was in the world) and then ſtretching it a little, all the Waters were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly emptied; ſo that with one Hand I eaſily drew forth the reſt of the Body, to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Chirurgeon, whom I could never perſwade that the Infant was ſo full of the Dropſy.</p>
               <p>After it was thus drawn forth, I had the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to fill up the Belly with Water, by the hole I had made, to the end we might ſee what quantity of Water had been there contained, and of what bigneſs it might be when filled: I poured in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lying, above five Quarts, which I ſhould hardly have believed, if I had not ſeen it my ſelf; and when the Belly was filled with Water, it was of the bigneſs and figure of a very great Foot-ball. I have ſet down here all the circumſtances of this Hiſtory, that the Chirurgeon may know how to behave himſelf on the like occaſion.</p>

               <p>FOr the moſt part when an Infant preſents any part of his Body together with the Head, it is uſually one or both the Hands rather than any other, which hinders its Birth; becauſe the Hands take up part of the Paſſage, and for the moſt part they cauſe the Head to lean on one ſide. When the Child comes thus, it is quite contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>To remedy this, aſſoon as 'tis perceived that one Hand preſents together with the Head, it muſt be prevented from coming down more, or ingaging further in the Paſſage; wherefore the Chirurgeon having placed the Woman on the Bed, with her Head a little lower than her Hips, muſt put and guide back the Infants Hand with his own as much as may be; or both of them, if they both come down, for to give way to the Childs Head; which having done, if the Childs Head be on one ſide, it muſt be brought into its natural Poſture in the middle of the Paſſage, that it may come in a ſtrait line, proceeding further as I have directed before in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of this Book, which treats of the Childs Head coming on one ſide.</p>

               <p>WHen an Infant preſents only one or both Hands to the birth, or an Arm ſometimes out to the Elbow, and many times to the Shoulder, it is one of the worſt and moſt dangerous Poſtures a Child can come in, as well for himſelf as for his Mother; becauſe of the violent force the Chirurgeon is<note n="*" place="margin">Not alwaies, though often times.</note> alwaies obliged to uſe both to the one and the other in ſearching for the Feet, which are very far off, by which he muſt alwaies in theſe Caſes, turn and draw him forth; which will often make him ſweat in the midſt of Winter, becauſe of the difficulty in this Labour more than in all the reſt, though ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them indeed are more dangerous for the Infant; as when it preſents the Belly, and the Navel-ſtring comes forth: but not ſo painful for the Chirurgeon, becauſe the Feet of the Infant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near the Paſſage, are not ſo hard to be found, as when he comes with a Hand; for then they are high, at the very bottom ſometimes of the Womb, where he muſt ſeek them, for to turn it and draw it forth, as I am going to direct.</p>

and if it be not ſufficiently dilated, he will be a good while before he can exactly diſtinguiſh between the Hands and Feet, by reaſon they are ſometimes ſo ſhut and preſt together, that they ſeem to be all of one and the ſame ſhape: but when the Womb is open enough for to introduce the Hand into it, he will eaſily know which are the Hands, and which the Feet; and having well taken notice of it, let him ſlide his Hand, and preſently direct it towards the Infants Breaſt, which he will find very near, and by that<note n="*" place="margin">Unneceſſary.</note> let him gently thruſt back the Body towards the bottom of the Womb, leaving the Feet in the ſame place where he found them; having therefore pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Woman in a convenient Poſture, that is, her Hips a little raiſed above her Breaſt and Head, which ſcituation ought alwaies to be obſerved when the Child is to be put back into the Womb, let him afterwards take hold of him by the Feet, and draw him forth according to the way before directed in its proper Chapter.</p>
               <p>This Labour truly is a little troubleſome, but nothing near ſo much as that we have mentioned in the preceding Chapter, where the Child pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents only his Hands: for in that the Feet muſt be ſearched a great way off, and it muſt be quite turned about, before it can be drawn forth; but in this, they are ready, preſenting themſelves, and there is not much to do, but to lift and thruſt back a little the upper part of the Body, which is almoſt done of it ſelf<note n="*" place="margin">Sufficient, and the beſt way in this Birth.</note> by drawing it alone by the Feet.</p>

                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:171433:147"/>Thoſe Authors that have written of Labours, and never practiſed them, as many Phyſicians have done, do order all by the ſame precept often reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, that is, to reduce all wrong Births to a natural Figure; which is to turn it, that it may come with the Head firſt: but if they themſelves had ever had the leaſt experience, they would know that it is very often impoſſible; at leaſt if it were to be done, by the exceſs of violence, that muſt neceſſarily be uſed to effect it, it would go near to deſtroy both Mother and Child in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: a <hi>Fiat</hi> in this Caſe is ſoon ſaid and ordered; but it is not ſo eaſily executed as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. For my part I am of an opinion cleer contrary to theirs, and ſuch as are skilfull in the Art will ſurely agree with me in it, that is, that (whenſoever the Infant comes wrong in what Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ſoever from the Shoulders to the Feet) it<note n="*" place="margin">A good note.</note> is the beſt way, and ſooneſt done, to draw it forth by the Feet; ſearching for them, if they do not preſent themſelves, rather than to try to put it into a natural Poſture, and place the Head fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: for the great endeavours often neceſſary to be uſed in turning the Infant in the Womb (which is a little harder than to turn a Pancake in a frying Pan) doth ſo weaken both Mother and Child, that there remains not afterwards ſtrength enough for to commit the Operation to the work of Nature, and uſually the Woman hath no more Throwes nor Pains fit for Labour, after ſhe hath been ſo wrought upon; for which cauſe it would be very tedious and difficult, as alſo the Infant, which is already very weak, would certainly periſh in the Paſſage, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:171433:148"/>
being able to be born. Wherefore it is much better in theſe caſes immediatly to fetch it by the Feet, ſearching for them as I have already direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they do not preſent themſelves, by which a tedious Labour will be prevented to the Mother, and the Child will be often brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, who without it will ſcarce eſcape death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can be brought forth by the ſtrength of Nature.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Of a Delivery where the Child comes with Shoulder, Back, or Breaſt.</head>
               <p>THe moſt difficult of theſe three ſorts of Figures and Scituations, in which Infants ſometimes come, is that of the Shoulders; becauſe it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from the Feet of the Infant, and the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon muſt find them, for to draw it forth. The next is the Back: and the Breech, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, cauſeth leaſt trouble, not only becauſe the Feet are nearer, but alſo becauſe by this Figure, the Head and Neck of the Infant is not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and lockt, as in the other ſcituations.</p>
               <p>For to remedy this Birth of the Shoulder, ſome adviſe that it ſhould be put back, to make way for the Head of the Infant, that ſo it may be reduced to a natural Birth: but it is much better, for the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:171433:151"/>
reaſons above alledged in the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of this Book, to try to bring it by the Feet; for to effect which, the Chirurgeon muſt thruſt the Shoulder a little back with his Hand, that ſo he may have more liberty to introduce it into the Womb, and ſliding it then along the Childs body, either by the Belly or ſide, as he finds it eaſieſt, he ſhall fetch the Feet, and turning it, bring them to the Paſſage, and ſo deliver the Woman, as is already directed.</p>
               <p>If it be the Back, which preſents to the Birth, it is alſo impoſſible to be born in that Poſture, what Pains ſoever the Mother endures; and beſides the Child having the Body folded inwards and almoſt double, his Breaſt and Belly are ſo preſt together, that he uſually wants little of being ſuffocated: to avoid which, the Chirurgeon muſt quickly ſlide up his Hand, along the Back towards the inferiour parts, until he meets the Feet, for to bring it forth the ſame way as if it came Footling.</p>
               <p>But when the Child comes with the Breech, if it be ſmall, and the Mother big, having the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages very large, he may ſometimes with a little help be born ſo; for though he comes double, yet the Thighs being folded towards the Belly, which is ſoft and gives way, it paſſeth without much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Aſſoon as the Chirurgeon finds the Child to come with the Buttocks foremoſt, he muſt not permit it to engage lower in the Paſſage; for it will not come ſo, unleſs it be very ſmall, and the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage very large, as we have already ſaid. This being then in good time perceived, he muſt, if he can, thruſt back the Breech, and ſliding up his Hand along the Thighs to the Legs and Feet of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:171433:151"/>
the Child, he muſt bring them gently one after the other forth of the Womb, by folding, ſtretching, wagging, and drawing them gently towards the ſide, being careful not to winde them too much, or cauſe a diſlocation; and then let him draw forth the reſt of the Body, as if it came with the Feet foremoſt.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid that the Chirurgeon perceiving the Child to come with the Breech foremoſt, ought to put it back, if he can; for ſometimes he will be advanced ſo forward in the Paſſage, that you may ſooner deſtroy both Mother and Child, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it back, when once ſtrongly engaged: When this happens, he cannot hinder it from coming in this Poſture, in which his Belly is ſo preſſed, that he often voids the<note n="*" place="margin">Childs ordure.</note> 
                  <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conium</hi> by his Fundament. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may much help this Birth, by ſliding up one or two Fingers of each Hand on each ſide of the Buttocks, for to introduce them into the Groins, and having crooked them inward, he muſt draw the Breech juſt out to the Thighs, &amp; then by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wagging it from ſide to ſide, he will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage them from the Paſſage, as alſo the Feet and Legs one after the other, being careful of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locating any part, and then he may extract the reſt as before, when coming with the Feet. The firſt Woman I ever layd, was of a Child which I drew<note n="†" place="margin">This way ought to be avoided if poſſible.</note> thus forth with the Buttocks fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; being conſtrained to it, becauſe aſſoon as ever the Waters broke (which happened before I could arrive to hinder it) they were ſo forward, that it was impoſſible to do it

otherwiſe, which I performed very well and in ſhort time, without prejudice to the Mother or Child, doing as I have directed.</p>

               <p>THe Back-bone may eaſily be bent and turned forwards a little, but by no means back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards without exceſſive violence. Wherefore the worſt and moſt dangerous Figure that a Child can offer in the Womb to the Birth, is the Belly or the Breaſt; for then its Body is conſtrained to bend backwards, and whatever Throws or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the Woman makes to bring it forth, it will never be accompliſhed, for ſhe will ſooner periſh with her Child, than ever advance it in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture into the Paſſage, wherefore it is in great danger, if not timely ſuccoured. And in caſe it ſhould eſcape, which would be very ſtrange, it would be a long while after its birth weak in the Back. But that which augments the danger much more is, that for the moſt part the Navel-ſtring comes forth when the Child comes with the Belly. Therefore aſſoon as it is diſcovered to be ſo, the Chirurgeon muſt apply the ſole remedy of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it forth by the Feet as ſpeedily as may be, in the following manner.</p>

               <p>When a Child comes with Breaſt or Belly, the Chirurgeon muſt always proceed after the ſame manner in both, inaſmuch as they require the ſame circumſtances. An Infant may likewiſe come with the Side, which way it is as impoſſible to paſs as the two former: but it is not ſo much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, nor is this ſcituation ſo cruel; for it may remain in it a longer time without dying, than in the two former, wherein it is much more racked than in this, in which the Body may be bended forward, and not backward, as in the other; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Navel-ſtring come forth ſo eaſy, as when it comes with the Belly firſt. In this, as in the other two Births, the Chirurgeon muſt draw the Child forth by the Feet on this faſhion; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving placed the Woman as ſhe ought to be, he may puſh back a little with his hand the Infants body, the better to introduce it, which he may ſlide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Thighs, till he finds the Legs and Feet, by which he muſt turn it, and afterwards draw it forth, juſt in the ſame manner as before, with
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:171433:154"/>
the ſame obſervations. Nor ought he to amuſe himſelf in any of theſe three Births, for to place the Head right, that it might come naturally; becauſe it is in great danger of dying in theſe unnatural Poſitions, if not drawn forth with ſpeed; which can never be effected, unleſs it be by finding the Feet, as I have directed.</p>

               <p>Sometime ſince I delivered two Women within a Week one of the other, both of Twins, one of each being dead, and the other living: the living Child of the firſt Woman was born before the dead: and the dead of the ſecond was expelled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the living. And the ſame thing happens every day in reſpect of ſtrong and weak Children: for that which is neareſt the Birth, whether alive or dead, ſtrong or weak, is always firſt born, or muſt be brought firſt, if it cannot come of it ſelf; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the difficulty of the Labour would yet be augmented as well in length of time to the Mother, as the violence done to the firſt Child, in putting it back, for to fetch the ſecond firſt.</p>
               <p>In the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. we ſhewed, ſpeaking of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Labours, how a Woman ſhould be delivered of Twins, coming both right: it now remains to direct what ought to be done, when they come either both wrong, or one of them only, as it is for the moſt part: the firſt coming right, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:171433:156"/>
Footling, or any other worſe Poſture: and then muſt the Birth of the firſt be haſtened as much as may be, that ſo there may be preſently way for the ſecond (which hath ſuffered much by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Poſition) to fetch it by the Feet, without trying to place it right, although it were ſomewhat inclined to it; becauſe it hath been already ſo tired and weakened, as alſo the Woman by the Birth of the firſt, that there would be more danger, that it would ſooner dye, than come of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Sometimes when the firſt is born naturally, the ſecond offers the Head likewiſe to the Birth: in this Caſe, 'tis good committing a work ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, to Nature to finiſh, provided ſhe be not too ſlow; for a Child may dye although right, by lying too long in the Birth; and the Woman, who hath been much tormented with bearing the firſt, is uſually ſo tyred and diſcouraged, when ſhe thinks that but half her work is over, that ſhe hath no more Pains, or very few and ſlow, nor any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Throws to bear the Second as ſhe had done the Firſt. Wherefore if the birth of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond proves tedious, and the Woman grows weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, let the Chirurgeon defer it no longer, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Hand gently into the <hi>Matrix,</hi> to find the Feet, and ſo draw forth the ſecond Child; which will eaſily be effected, becauſe there is way made ſufficient by the birth of the firſt: and if the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Waters be not broke, as it often happens, yet intending to fetch it Footling, he need not ſcruple to break<note n="*" place="margin">Skins or skirts.</note> the <hi>Membranes</hi> with his Fingers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though elſwhere we have forbidden it; but that muſt be underſtood with diſtinction: for when a
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:171433:156"/>
Labour is left to Natures work, they muſt break of themſelves; but when a Child ſhall be extracted by Art, there is no danger in breaking them; nay contrarily they muſt be broke, that the Child may be the eaſier turned, which elſe would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Above all, the Chirurgeon muſt be careful not to be deceived, when both Children together offer to the Birth either their Hands or Feet, and muſt well conſider in the Operation, whether they be not joined together, or any otherways monſtrous; as alſo which part belongs to one Child, and which to the other, that ſo they may be fetcht one after the other, and not both together, as would be if it were not duely conſidered, taking the right Foot of the one, and the left of the other, and ſo drawing them together, as if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed both to one Body, becauſe there is a left and a right, by which means it would be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ever to deliver them: but it may eaſily be prevented, if having found two or three Feet of ſeveral Children preſenting together in the Paſſage, and taking aſide two of the forwardeſt, a right and a left, and ſliding his Hand along the Legs and Thighs up to the Twiſt, if forwards; or to the Buttocks, if backwards, he finds they both belong to one Body; and being certain of it, he may then begin to draw forth the neareſt, without regard which is ſtrongeſt or weakeſt, bigger or leſs, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or dead, having firſt put a little aſide that part of the other Child which offers, to have the more way, and ſo diſpatch the firſt whatever it is, aſſoon as may be; obſerving the ſame Rules, as if there were but one, that is, keeping the Breaſt and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:171433:157"/>
Face downwards, with every circumſtance directed where the Child comes Footling, and not fetch the Burthen, till the ſecond Child be born; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is commonly but one for both, which if it were looſened from the ſides of the Womb, would cauſe a flooding, for the reaſons already alledged, that the orifices of the Veſſels to which it was joined would continue open by this ſeparation, as long as the Womb was dîſtended by the other Child, yet within it, and never cloſe (as it often happens) till being quite emptied of all, it begins to contract it ſelf, and retire (as a man may ſay) within it ſelf.</p>
               <p>When therefore the Chirurgeon hath drawn forth one Child, he muſt ſeparate it from the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, having tyed and cut the Navel-ſtring, and then fetch the other by the Feet in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and afterwards bring the Burthen with the two ſtrings, as hath been ſhewed in the proper place. If the Children offer any other part than the Feet, the ſame courſe muſt be taken as is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the foregoing Chapters, where the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral unnatural Figures are diſcourſed of, alwayes obſerving for the reaſons abovementioned to begin the Operation with the Child that is loweſt in the Paſſage, and in the moſt commodious Figure for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> Of a Labour when the Navel-ſtring comes firſt.</head>
               <p>AN Infant doth not alwaies preſent with the Belly when the Navel-ſtring comes firſt: for though he preſents naturally as to the Figure of his Body, that is with the Head firſt, yet ſometimes the Navel-ſtring falls down and comes before it; for which cauſe the Child is in much danger of death, at leaſt if the Labour be not very quick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Blood (that ought to paſs and repaſs through thoſe Veſſels which compoſe it, for to nouriſh and enliven the Child, whilſt he continues in the Womb) being coagulated, hinders the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation wh ch ought to be there made; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens as well by the contuſion, as the cold thoſe Veſſels receive, being much preſſed in the Paſſage, when it comes together with the Head or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, as alſo becauſe the Blood doth there coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate (as is ſaid) by reaſon of the cold which it takes by the coming forth of the Navel-ſtring.</p>
               <p>But though this accident may cauſe the Infants ſuddain death, 'tis not ſo much for wart of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, without which he might paſs a day or more, there being blood enough in his Body for that purpoſe: but becauſe the Blood can be no longer vivified and renewed by Circulation, as it hath continual need, which being obſtructed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies cauſeth the creatures ſudden death, ſooner
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:171433:159"/>
or later, according as it is more or leſs obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>I know it may be objected, that though the Circulation be ſo hindered and intercepted by the coming forth of the String, it need not therefore cauſe ſuch a ſudden death to the Child, becauſe the Blood may notwithſtanding circulate in all the other parts of the body: to which I anſwer, that in reſpect to the Infant, 'tis either abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Blood, for want of reſpiration, ſhould be elaborated or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the<note n="*" place="margin">Thick part of the Burthen.</note> 
                  <hi>Placenta,</hi> and therefore there muſt be a free communication, or for want of it, that the Infant muſt immediatly breath by the mouth, as well to be refreſhed, as to drive forth by exſpiration the fuliginous vapours, which not being poſſible whilſt in the Womb, it muſt unavoidably be choaked and dye in a very ſmall time, if it wants both together. Wherefore in this caſe the Woman muſt without any delay be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, which if Nature doth not ſpeedily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, the Child muſt be drawn forth by the Feet.</p>
               <p>Women that have great Waters and a long ſtring to the Burthen are very ſubject to this miſchief; for the Waters coming forth in great abundance at the breaking of the Membranes, do often at that inſtant draw the ſtring which ſwims in the midſt, forth along with them, and much the eaſier if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Head be not advanced very forward into the Paſſage, for to hinder the coming forth of it in this manner.</p>

endeavour to put it back, to prevent the cooling of it, behind the Childs head, leſt it be bruiſed as we have already noted, whereby the blood may coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate there; keeping it in that place where it was thruſt back, until the Head being fully come down into the Paſſage, may hinder the coming down of it again: which may be effected by holding it up with the Fingers of one hand on that ſide it comes down, until the Head be advanced as aboveſaid; or in caſe the hand be taken away, to put a piece of fine ſoft rag between that ſide of the Head and the Womb, for to ſtop up the way it came down by, alwaies leaving an end of the rag without the body, for to draw it forth by at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But ſometimes, notwithſtanding all theſe cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the putting back of it, it will yet come forth every Pain: then without further delays the Chirurgeon muſt bring the Child forth by the Feet, which he muſt ſearch for, though the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant comes with the Head; for there is but this only means to ſave the Childs life, which it would certainly loſe by the leaſt delay in this caſe. Wherefore having placed the Woman conveniently, let him gently put the Head, which offers, back; (provided it be not engaged too low among the bones of the Paſſage, and that it may be done without too great violence to the Woman, for in that caſe<note n="*" place="margin">See the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note> it will be better to let the Child run the hazard of dying, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Mother) and then ſlide up his Hand well anointed under the Breaſt and Belly to ſearch for the Feet, by which he muſt draw it forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former directions; this being diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:171433:160"/>
let him immediatly take great care of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, which is ever in this caſe very feeble.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi> Of a Labour wherein the Burthen either firſt offers, or firſt comes quite forth.</head>
               <p>THe coming forth of the Navel-ſtring before the Infant, of which we have treated in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, is often cauſe of his death, for the reaſons there given: but the coming firſt of the Burthen, is yet much more dangerous; for beſides that the Children are then ordinarily Still-born, if they be not aſſiſted in the very inſtant, the Mother likewiſe is often in very great peril of her life; becauſe of her great floodings, which uſually happen, when it is looſened from the Womb before its due time, becauſe it leaves all the Orifices of the Veſſels open, to which it did cleave, whence flowes inceſſantly Blood, until the Child be born: becauſe the Womb, whilſt any thing continues there, doth every moment ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to expel it, by which means it continually voids and epreſſeth the blood of the Veſſels, which are always open (as we have already often explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) when the Burthen is ſo ſeparated, as long as the Womb remains extended and cannot be cloſed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it hath voided all that it did contain, and comes by the contraction of its membranous ſubſtance to ſtop them, by preſſing them together. Wherefore if we ought to be vigilant to ſuccour an Infant
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:171433:160"/>
when the String comes firſt, we ought much more to be ſo when the Burthen comes forth firſt, and the leaſt delay is ever cauſe of the Infants ſudden death, if the Woman be not ſpeedily delivered; becauſe the Infant cannot ſtay then long in the Womb without ſuffocation, ſtanding then in need of breathing by the Mouth (as is explained in the foregoing Chapter) the Blood being no longer vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the preparation made in the Burthen, the uſe and ſunction of which then ceaſeth, from the inſtant it is ſeparated from the Veſſels of the Womb, to which it was joined, for which reaſon there immediatly follows a great flooding, which is ſo dangerous for the Mother, that without ſpeedy help, ſhe ſoon loſeth her life by this unlucky ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
               <p>When the Burthen is not wholy come forth, but lies in the Paſſage, ſome adviſe to put it back before the Child be fetcht; but I am not of that opinion, for when it comes into the Paſſage before the Infant, it is then totally divided from the Womb, at the bottom of which it ought ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be ſcituated and faſtened, until the Child be born: but, becauſe (aſſoon as it is wholly looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as it alwaies is when it comes firſt) it becomes a Body altogether unnatural; it muſt never be thruſt back, but contrarily be ferched away, and at the very moment after bring the Child by the Feet, although it came naturally with the Head firſt: for what reaſon can there be to put it back, ſince it is of no uſe to the Infant, from the moment it is ſeparated from the Womb, as cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied? And ſuch a proceeding is ſo farr from being uſeful, that this Burthen would much hinder the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:171433:161"/>
Chirurgeon from being able to turn the Child, as he ought, for to bring it by the Feet.</p>
               <p>Wherefore when it preſents in the Paſſage, which may be ſoon perceived if they find every where a ſoft ſubſtance, without the leaſt reſiſtance to the touch of any ſolid part; finding likewiſe the String faſtened to the middle of it, and the Woman flooding extremely, as is ordinary at ſuch times: then, inſtead of thruſting it back, the Burthen muſt be brought away, that ſo there may be more liberty and room to extract the Child, according to former direction.</p>
               <p>The Burthen, being quite looſened from the Womb, and coming firſt in the Paſſage, muſt not be thruſt back into it again, much leſs muſt it be put back, when is is quite come forth of the Body: Care muſt be only taken not to cut the String till the Child be born, not out of hopes of any benefit from it to the Infant during the Delivery, but that ſo much time may not be loſt before the Infant be fetcht, which is then ever in great danger, as alſo the flooding may be the ſooner ſtopt, which happens for the moſt part aſſoon as the Woman is delivered, for which reaſons it muſt be with all poſſible ſpeed diſpatched.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, notwithſtanding this dangerous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, the Child may be born alive, if timely ſuccoured: but it is then ſo weak, that 'tis hard to diſcover at firſt, whether it be living or dead.</p>
               <p>When it ſo happens, the Midwives do ordinarily before they ſeparate the Burthen put it into a skellet of hot Wine, and imagine, with no ſmall Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, that in caſe it comes to it ſelf, the vapours of the warm Wine was the cauſe of it, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:171433:161"/>
by means of the String into the Infants Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo giving it vigour: but it is more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that being almoſt ſuffocated for want of reſpiration aſſoon as it needed it, it begins now by means of it to recover from that fainting: but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, there is no hurt in keeping the cuſtome, though ſuperſtitious, ſince it can do no prejudice, and may ſatisfie preoccupied ſpirits, provided ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries be not neglected, in being blindly carried away with this conceipt.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> How to deliver a Woman when the Child is Hydropical, or Monſtrous.</head>
               <p>A Child may in the Womb have either the Dropſy of the Head, called <hi>Hydrocephale,</hi> or of the Breaſt, or of the Belly: And when theſe parts are ſo filled with Water (as I have ſometimes met with) that they are much too big for the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through which the Child muſt iſſue; then, notwithſtanding any Throws or Endeavors the Woman may attempt to bring it forth, 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhe ſhould effect it without the help of Art: as likewiſe when the Child is monſtrous, either by being only too big in the whole Body, or in any particular part, or by being joined to another Child.</p>
               <p>If the Child be living that hath the Dropſy, when the Woman is in Labour, it muſt be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſave the Mother, by making a hole in either the Head, Breaſt or Belly of it, where the Waters are contained, that being emptied by the apertion ſo made, the Child may the eaſier be drawn forth, or elſe he muſt neceſſarily dye in the Womb, not being able to be born, and remaining there will alſo kill the Mother; wherefore to ſave her life, the Infant muſt be by an<note n="*" place="margin">See the Preface.</note> indiſpenſable neceſſity brought forth by Art, ſince 'tis impoſſible it ſhould come of it ſelf, which may
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:171433:162"/>
be done with a crooked Knife ſharp at the very point, like that marked <hi>C,</hi> among the Inſtruments at the end of the Second Book, the Chirurgeon proceeding in the following manner.</p>
               <p>After <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>at the Woman is placed conveniently for the Operation, he muſt ſlide up his left Hand on the right ſide of the interiour part of the Infants Head, if the Waters be continued therein, which he will perceive by the extraordinary bigneſs and extent of it, the <hi>Sutures</hi> much ſeparated, and the Bones of it far diſtant one from the other, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diſtenſion made by the incloſed Waters, of which being very certain, let him ſlide with his right Hand along the inſide of his left this crooked Knife, taking care that the point of it in introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it, be alwaies towards his left Hand, for fear of wounding the Womb, and having conducted it cloſe up to the Head, againſt one of the <hi>Sutures,</hi> let him turn the Knife towards it, and make an apertion large enough to let out the Water, and then it will be very eaſie to bring forth the Child; foraſmuch as the other parts are then uſually ſmall and much conſumed.</p>
               <p>If theſe Waters were contained in the Breaſt or Belly, then the Childs Head, being no bigger than ordinary, may be born; but the Body being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſwelled with the Waters will ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, as it happened to that Child that had a Dropſy of the Belly, which I mentioned in the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of this Book, to which I refer you, becauſe 'tis much to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The caſe being thus, let the Chirurgeon ſlide up his left Hand, as aforeſaid, and the inſtrument with the right, juſt to the Breaſt or Belly, for to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:171433:163"/>
make an Inciſion, juſt as I did in the ſame caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the ſaid 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. for to let out the Waters, after which he may with much eaſe finiſh the Operation.</p>
               <p>You muſt know, that 'tis much more difficult to deliver a Monſtrous Birth, or two joined together, than one that hath the Dropſy: becauſe the bigneſs of the Hydropick parts may be eaſily leſſened by a ſingle inciſion, which is ſufficient to let out the Waters which diſtend, and then 'tis eaſie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch the reſt.</p>
               <p>But when a monſtrous Child is to be extracted, or a double one, a ſingle apertion is not enough, but ſometimes 'tis neceſſary to take off whole mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from thoſe Bodies, which makes the Operation much more painful and laborious, and requires more time and skill to effect it; in which caſe the left Hand muſt be introduced into the Womb, and the ſharp Knife of the right juſt to the parts that are to be divided and ſeparated, and there with all the care that may be, the member of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Child muſt, if poſſible, be taken off juſt at the Joint; and when there are two Children joined together, the Separation muſt be made juſt in the place where they join, and afterwards they may be delivered one after the other; always taking them by the Feet; and if it hath but one, the ſame thing may be accompliſhed, after having leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened the bigneſs of it, by cutting off ſome one of the Members.</p>
               <p>I have already ſhown in the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of this Book, ſpeaking of the extraction of a Childs Head left alone behind in the Womb, of what faſhion this Inſtrument ought to be, that the Operation may
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:171433:163"/>
be conveniently performed, and that it ſhould be as long as an ordinary Crochet, for the more ſurety and facility; becauſe that holding the handle of it with the right Hand, it may be thruſt, drawn, ſloaped and turned without pain to any ſide at pleaſure; and with the left, which is within the Womb, it may be guided for to cut and diſmember more skilfully and eaſily thoſe parts which muſt be ſeparated. Wherefore it ought to have a Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſo long, that the Chirurgeons right Hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Womb may hold and govern it as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and conduct it the better in the Operation, which could not be ſo ſafely and conveniently done, if this inſtrument were ſo very ſhort, as all other Authors recommend: becauſe in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Chirurgeons hand is ſo conſtrained and preſſed in the Womb, that he can hardly there have the liberty to move his Fingers ends, which is the cauſe why he cannot without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty govern ſuch an Inſtrument with one Hand only, unleſs he would very much force and offer violence to the Womb, and exceedingly endanger thereby the poor Womans life. Let us now come to the extraction of a dead Child, and ſhow the ſeveral ways of doing it.</p>

for the moſt part it comes wrong; or, though it comes right with the Head, the Womans Pains are ſo weak and ſlow in theſe caſes, that ſhe cannot bring it forth, and ſometimes ſhe hath none at all; foraſmuch as Nature half overthrown by the death of the Child, which cannot help it ſelf, labours ſo little, that many times it cannot finiſh the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it hath begun, but muſt yeeld without the help of Art, of which at that time it hath great need: However, before you come to Manual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, endeavour to ſtir up the Womans Pains with ſharp and ſtrong Clyſters, for to bring on Throws to bear down and bring forth the Child: but if this prevails not, ſhe muſt be deliverd by Art.</p>
               <p>We have declared in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of this Book the ſigns to know a dead Child in the Womb, of which the chief are; if the Woman perceives it not to ſtir, nor hath a long time before; if ſhe be very cold, much pain and heavineſs in the bottom of her Belly; if the Child be not ſupported, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways falls like a maſs of Lead to that ſide on which the Woman lies, if the Burthen or Navelſtring hath been a long time in the World; and if no Pulſation be there felt, and that dark and ſtinking putrid matter comes away from the Womb. All theſe ſigns together, or moſt of them, ſhew the Child is aſſuredly dead; which when the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon is certain of, he muſt do his endeavour to fetch it aſſoon as poſſibly he can, and having placed the Woman according to former directions; if the Child offers the Head firſt, he muſt gently put it back until he hath liberty to introduce his Hand quite into the Womb, and ſliding it all along un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the Belly to find the Feet, let him draw it forth by them, as is formerly taught; being very careful to keep the Head from being lockt in the Paſſage, and that it be not ſeparated from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which may eaſily be done when the Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very rotten and putrified, the Chirurgeon doth not obſerve the circumſtances often repeated by us, that is (in drawing it forth) to keep the Breaſt and Face downwards: And if, nothwithſtanding all theſe precautions, the Head, becauſe of the great putrifaction, ſhould be ſeparated and remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the Womb, it muſt be drawn forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the directions formerly given in the proper Chapter.</p>
               <p>But when the Head coming firſt is ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced and engaged among the Bones of the Paſſage, that it cannot be put back, then being very ſure by all the Signs together, or moſt of the chief of them, that the Child is certainly dead, 'tis better to draw it ſo forth, than to torment the Woman too much by putting it back, for to turn it and bring it by the Feet: but becauſe it being a part round and ſlippery, by reaſon of the moiſture, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon cannot take hold of it with his Fingers, nor put them upon the ſide of it, becauſe the Paſſage is filled with its bigneſs, he muſt take a<note n="*" place="bottom">Though this Crochet cannot hurt a dead Child, yet it may endanger the Woman, by ſlipping: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tranſlator of this Treatiſe cannot approve of it, having an eaſier and ſafer way to do this Operation, as he mentions in his Preface to this Book.</note> Crochet

than kill her, by tormenting her with exceſſive violence for to bring it whole: but in a word, we muſt in conſcience do what Art commands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heed to what may be ſpoken afterwards, and every Chirurgeon, that hath a well ordered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, will ever have a greater regard to his duty than reputation; in performing of which let him expect his reward from God.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXII.</hi> Of extracting a <hi>Mola</hi> and falſe Conception.</head>
               <p>HAving at large ſpoken in another place of the Cauſes, Signs and Differences of <hi>Mola</hi>'s and falſe Conceptions, and ſhewed that a <hi>Mola</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ariſeth from a falſe Conception, there remains nothing to be demonſtrated but the manner how it ought to be extracted. Now ſince theſe things contained in the Womb, are totally preternatural, their expulſion muſt be procured aſſoon as poſſible, which is very difficult, when theſe ſtrange Bodies cleave to it, and eſpecially the <hi>Mola,</hi> which not being drawn forth, will often continue ſo faſtened two or three whole years, nay ſometimes the whole remaining part of the Womans life, as <hi>Paré</hi> tells us in the Story of the Pewterers wife that had one ſeventeen years, whom he opened after her death.</p>
               <p>To avoid the like accident and abundance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which a <hi>Mola</hi> brings, it muſt be endeavoured to be expelled aſſoon as may be, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before you come to Manual Operation, to cauſe
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:171433:168"/>
the Woman to expel it of her ſelf: to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe give her ſtrong and ſharp Clyſters, to ſtir up Throwes for to open the Womb to give way to it, relaxing and moiſtening it with emollient Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Oyls and Greaſe, not omitting bleeding in the Foot, and half Baths, if there be occaſion. The <hi>Mola</hi> will certainly be excluded by theſe means, provided it be but of an indifferent big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or that it adheres little or not at all to the Womb; but if it cleaves very ſtrongly to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Womb, or that it be very big, the Woman will hardly be rid of it without the help of a Chirurgeons hand; in which caſe, after that he hath placed the Woman conveniently, as if he were to fetch a dead Child, let him ſlide his Hand into the Womb, and with it draw forth the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> uſing (if it be ſo big as that it cannot be brought whole, which is very rare, becauſe it is a ſoft ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der body, much more plyable than a Child) a Crochet or Knife to draw it forth, or divide it into two or more parts, as the caſe ſhall require. If the Chirurgeon finds it joined and faſtened to the Womb, he muſt gently ſeparate it with his Fingers ends, his Nailes being well pared, putting them by little and little between the <hi>Mola</hi> and the Womb, beginning on that ſide where it doth not ſtick ſo faſt, and purſuing it ſo until it be quite looſened; being very careful, if it grows too faſt, not to rend nor hurt the proper ſubſtance of the Womb, proceeding according to the directions we have given for the extraction of a Burthen ſtaying behind in the Womb when the String is broke off.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Mola</hi> never hath any String faſtened to it,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:171433:168"/>
nor any Burthen from whence it ſhould receive its nouriſhment: but it doth of it ſelf immediatly draw it from the Veſſels of the Womb, to which it is almoſt alwaies joined, and ſticking in ſome place. The ſubſtance of its Fleſh is alſo much more hard than that of the Burthen, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is <hi>ſchirrous,</hi> which is the cauſe, why it is not ſo eaſily ſeparated from the Womb.</p>
               <p>As to a falſe Conception, though it be much leſs than a <hi>Mola;</hi> yet it often puts a Woman in hazard of her life, becauſe of great Floodings, which very often happens, when the Womb would diſcharge it ſelf of it, and endeavors to expel it: which ſeldom ceaſeth until it be come away; becauſe it doth ſtill endeavour to exclude it, by which the Blood is excited to flow away, and in a manner ſqueeſed out of the open Veſſels.</p>
               <p>The beſt and ſafeſt remedy for the Woman in this caſe, is to fetch away the falſe Conception aſſoon as may be, becauſe the Womb can often ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly void it without help; for it being very ſmall, the Womans impulſe in bearing downwards cannot be ſo effectual when the Womb is but little diſtended by ſo ſmall a body, as when it contains a conſiderable Bulk in it; for then it is more ſtrongly compreſſed with the Throws. Many times 'tis exceeding difficult to fetch theſe falſe Conceptions, becauſe the Womb doth not open and dilate it ſelf ordinarily beyond the proportion of what it contains, and that being very little, ſo is its opening; which is the reaſon why the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon ſometimes is ſo far from introducing his whole Hand, that he can ſcarce put in a few Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, with which he is obliged to finiſh the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:171433:169"/>
as well as he can, proceeding in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner when he hath introduced them.</p>
               <p>Having well anointed his Hand, he muſt ſlide it up the <hi>Vagina</hi> unto the inward Orifice, which he will find ſometimes but very little dilated, and then very gently put in one of his Fingers, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:171433:169"/>I thought of cauſing ſuch an Inſtrument to be made upon an occaſion, where it would have ſtood me in good ſtead, if I had had it, with which I have ſince (proceeding according to the directions I have juſt now given) lately drawn forth a falſe Conception of the bigneſs of a Walnut, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt had elſe that day been the death of one named Madam <hi>le Roy,</hi> dwelling near the great Stairs at the place <hi>Maubert,</hi> by reaſon of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible loſs of Blood which it occaſioned, and which ceaſed aſſoon as I had drawn forth this Conception; which I could never have done any other way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inner Orifice of the Womb was not open, nor could be dilated more than for one Finger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, after the manner I have declared: beſides the preſſing danger of the accident, the delay of the Operation had indubitably been the death of this Woman, who, thanks be to God, is ſince well recovered.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIII.</hi> Of the <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Section.</head>
               <p>WHen a big-bellyed Woman is effectively in Labour, 'tis very rare but that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Chirurgeon can deliver the Child dead or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, whole or in pieces; in a word, that he may do the work completely, if he behaves himſelf as the caſe requires, and according to the directions given in each particular Chapter foregoing, treating of the ſeveral unnatural Labours, without being
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:171433:170"/>
neceſſitated in a very inhuman, cruel and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner to have recourſe to the <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration during the Mothers life, as ſome Authors have too inconſideratly ordered, and ſomtimes practiſed themſelves.</p>
               <p>In truth there would ſeem ſome pretext of a lawful excuſe to make Martyrs of theſe poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if it were to bring a ſecond <hi>Caeſar</hi> from them, whom they ſay was born in that manner, or ſome great and new Prophet. In the times of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Pagans they did uſe to ſacrifice innocent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims for the publick good, but never for a private. I know very well that they palliate it with a pretence of baptizing the Infant, which elſe would be deprived of it, becauſe the Mothers death is for the moſt part cauſe of the Childs: but I do not know that there ever was any Law, Chriſtian or Civil, which doth ordain the martyring and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mother, for to ſave the Child: 'Tis rather to ſatisfie the avarice of ſome people, who care not much whether their Wives die, provided they have a Child to ſurvive them; not ſo much for the ſake of Children, but to inherit by them afterwards; for which cauſe they do eaſily conſent to this cruel Operation, which is a damnable policy. If they ſay, to render the fact leſs horrible in appearance, that it muſt never be undertaken but when the Woman is reduced to the utmoſt extremity; to that I anſwer, that a Woman often recovers beyond hope or probability: And, if they object that ſhe may likewiſe eſcape after this Operation; I do ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny it, by the teſtimony of the moſt expert Chirurgeons that have practiſed it, who alwaies had bad ſucceſs, all the Women ever dying in a
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:171433:170"/>
ſhort time after. I do highly commend <hi>Guille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meau,</hi> who to diſabuſe the world for ſuch a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and pernicious practiſe, confeſſeth, ſpeaking of this fatal Operation, and ownes (by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) that he did himſelf twice in the preſence of <hi>Ambroſe Parê</hi> put it into practiſe, and ſaw it thrice done more by three ſeveral very expert Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, who omitted never a circumſtance to make it ſucceed well, and notwithſtanding all the Women died.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Parê,</hi> he will not acknowledg that he ſaw thoſe two Operations of <hi>Guillemean,</hi> becauſe he will not have Poſterity know that he was able to conſent to ſo great a cruelty; but contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with adviſing only, that it ſhould never be undertaken till the Woman is dead; becauſe there is no poſſibility ſhe ſhould eſcape it, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the irregular wound, which is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make for this purpoſe in the Belly, but chiefly for that in the Womb, and for the exceſſive Flux of Blood which will immediatly follow. However, contrary to the opinion of two ſuch famous Chirurgeons, there are ſome raſh perſons, who do obſtinately maintain (though with but as little reaſon as <hi>Rauſſet</hi>) that it is not impoſſible for a Woman to eſcape, becauſe they have ſeen ſome that have had the Bones of their dead Children come forth by an abſceſs of the Belly, after that the Fleſh of them had paſſed the natural way in Sup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uration, which Bones by little and little had pierced the Womb and the Belly alſo, and after that they were ſo drawn forth, yet the Women recovered. As alſo others did not dye, whoſe Wombs after Precipitation and perfect putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:171433:171"/>
and Gangrene, was totally cut away. Indeed we muſt acknowledg what experience hath many times taught us, as it hath theſe things, which I believe have happened, and may again as well as thoſe (though rarely): but it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that this <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Operation muſt needs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as well; becauſe here is made at one ſtroak a very great wound in the Belly and Womb, which is ever the death of the poor Woman immediatly, or ſoon after.</p>
               <p>But when Nature it ſelf begins to ſeparate and pierce theſe parts, by means of theſe Bones, to caſt them forth by ſome new way which it makes, not being able to do it by the common and natural, for want of the help in due time of skilful perſons, it doth it by degrees and not all at once; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure it drives theſe preternatural Bodies forth of the Womb, ſo it reunites and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins it at the ſame time proportionably, and without the leaſt Flux of Blood, which happens quite otherwiſe in the artificial Operation: and if it be true, that ſome Women have ever eſcaped it, we muſt believe it a Miracle, and the expreſs hand of God, (who can when He pleaſeth raiſe the dead, as he did <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and change the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when 'tis his good pleaſure) rather than an effect of humane prudence.</p>
               <p>There are many good Women who, for having only heard ſome Goſſips ſpeak of it, are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that they know ſuch and ſuch yet living, whoſe ſides had been ſo opened to fetch the Child ſo out of their Belly. Nay more, there are ſome that affirm they know thoſe that have had this Operation practiſed on them three or four times
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:171433:171"/>
ſucceſſively, and yet alive; and the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm ſo notable a lye, which they had only heard recited by others, and after having three or four times told it, believe it themſelves for truth, as much as if they had ſeen it with their own eyes, will tell ſo many circumſtances and particulars, that they eaſily perſwade thoſe that do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the impoſſibility of it.</p>
               <p>There are others agin, who ſhewing the ſcars of ſome abſceſs they have had in their Belly, would perſwade that a Child hath been taken out there; to which purpoſe I will relate what I once ſaw my ſelf, concerning a big-bellyed Woman that was in the <hi>Hôſtel de Dieu</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> when I there practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Deliveries. This Woman, whether through cunning, feigning to believe the thing, or through ignorance, really beleeving it, did teſtify to all the Women who were then in the ſaid <hi>Hôſtel de Dieu,</hi> as alſo to an infinite of other perſons, and amongſt the reſt to a good old Nun that governed all, whom they called Mother <hi>Bouquet,</hi> (and at that time did preſide in the Hall of Deliveries, like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goddeſs <hi>Lucina</hi>) that ſhe was very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that they muſt open her ſide to deliver her, as it had been two years before; in all which time ſhe had made the ſame relation to above a thouſand ſeveral perſons, each of which, it may be, had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain related it to as many more, ſhewing to all of them a great Skar, by which ſhe ſaid the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons had drawn the Child out of her Belly. Wherefore ſhe prayed Mother <hi>Bouquet</hi> to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her to me, deſiring rather to be delivered by me who was a Chirurgeon, becauſe ſhe might be more ſafely helped in ſuch a buſineſs, than by a
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:171433:172"/>
Midwife. This good Nun giving me this account, which ſhe verily beleeved according to the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I told her, that not having faith enough to imagine it, I could not believe the <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had been made on that Woman, as ſhe had perſwaded her. If you do not beleeve it, replied ſhe, I will fetch her preſently to you, and ſhe her ſelf ſhall tell you every circumſtance. And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly ſhe cauſed her to be fetch'd; who told me the ſame ſhe had told her: but having particularly examined her from what part the Child was ſo drawn forth, and whether ſhe felt any great pain in the Operation. She anſwered me, None; becauſe ſhe was then ſenſeleſs, and remained ſo five or ſix days after: I asked her then, how ſhe was certain that the Child was brought away by inciſion in her Belly, being ſhe was not at that time ſenſible? She anſwered, the Chirurgeons aſſured her it was ſo; and at the ſame time ſhe ſhewed me a great Skar, ſcituated juſt on the right ſide of her Breaſt, about the middle of the Ribs, where ſhe had a great abſceſs, of which this Skar remained; and when I had told her, that the Breaſt was not the place whence a Child ſhould be fetcht, and that I had with my arguments convinced her of the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of what ſhe had believed and made others to believe, as the women of the <hi>Hoſtel de Dieu</hi> and Mother <hi>Bouquet</hi> alſo; they began to be diſabuſed and continued ſo, when three days after this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, I had delivered her with the greateſt faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, although it was a very great Child, which came quickly. If one ſhould examine well the beginning of all the Stories of this Operation, ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighing them, as I did upon this occaſion,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:171433:172"/>
they would be found to be meer fables, and that that which <hi>Rouſſet</hi> reports of his <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Labours, is nothing but the ravings, capriciouſneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture of their Authors.</p>
               <p>Now if, becauſe of all theſe reaſons, a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon muſt never practiſe this cruel Operation whilſt the Mother is alive, although the Child be certainly ſo (which for all that may ſomtimes he very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) I pray what infamy would it be for him, if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo killed the Mother, the Child ſhould alſo be found dead, after it was thought to be alive? much more ought he to abſtain from it, when he is well aſſured it is dead; wherefore he had better pull it in pieces and bits (if it cannot be otherwiſe) by the natural way, than ſo to butcher the Mother for to have it whole; and if the Womb were ſo little open, that he could not have liberty to work there, nor introduce any inſtrument into it, he had better wait a little, alwaies trying to dilate the Paſſages by Art, as we have formerly directed, than to caſt her down almoſt in an inſtant, with ſuch a blow of deſpair, as the making of this <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarean</hi> Operation, which for this reaſon is never to be undertaken, till immediatly after the Mothers death, when the Chirurgeon muſt be preſent for to act according to the following directions, as well in hopes of finding the Child living, as to obey an Ordinance which expreſly forbids the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a Woman with Child before it is taken out of her Belly. To accompliſh which as it ought to be, when he perceives the Woman in the agony, he muſt quickly make ready all things neceſſary for his work, to loſe no time, becauſe delay will certainly be the death of the Infant, which elſe a
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:171433:173"/>
few moments before might have been brought alive: there are ſome, that when the Woman is juſt a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would have ſomewhat put between her Teeth to keep her Mouth open, and likewiſe in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the Womb: to the end the Infant receiving by this means ſome little air and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may not be ſo ſoon ſuffocated: but all this myſtery will avail but little; becauſe the Child lives only by the Mothers blood, whilſt it is in the Womb; but if he will needs do ſo, it is rather to content the company, than out of any belief of the good it will do. Aſſoon then as the Woman hath breathed her laſt, and that ſhe is dead (to which all the company muſt agree) he ſhall begin his Operation, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Embriulcie.</hi> Moſt Authors would have it made on the left ſide of the Belly, becauſe it is more free from the Liver, which is on the right; but if my opinion may be authentick, it will be better and more skilfully made juſt in the middle of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, between the two right Muſcles; becauſe in this place there is only the Coverings and the white Line to cut, when on the ſide it cannot be done without cutting the two oblique and croſs Muſcles, which being couched one under the other, makes a conſiderable thickneſs, beſides that it bleeds more than towards the middle of the Belly; not that the loſs of blood is of any moment (which will flow when the Woman is but juſt dead) but becauſe it hinders by its flowing, the ſeeing diſtinctly how to make the Operation as it ſhould be. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch then with more eaſe and ſpeed, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon having placed the dead Body that the Belly may be a little raiſed, let him take a good ſharp
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:171433:173"/>
inciſion Knife, very ſharp of one ſide, like that marked <hi>E</hi> in the table of Inſtruments at the end of this Chap. with which he muſt quickly make, at one ſtroak, or at two or three at moſt (if he will for the greater ſurety) an inciſion juſt in the middle of the Belly, between the two right Muſcles unto the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> of the length and extent of the Womb or thereabouts; after that he muſt only pierce the <hi>Peritoneum</hi> with the point of his Inſtrument, to make an orifice for one or two of the Fingers of his left Hand, into which he muſt immediatly thruſt them, for to cut it (lifting it up with them, and conducting the inſtrument for fear of pricking the Guts) in proportion to the firſt inciſion of the<note n="*" place="margin">Skins.</note> Coverings, which having done, the Womb will ſoon appear, in which he muſt make an inciſion in the ſame manner as he did in the <hi>Peritoneum;</hi> being careful not to thruſt his inſtrument at once too far in, thinking to find the Womb a finger or two thick, as all Authors affirm contrary to truth, in which he would be deceived, as thoſe are that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well conſidered it; for it is very certain, that at the time of Labour, whilſt it contains the Child and Waters in it, it is not above a ſingle line thick; or the thickneſs of half a Crown, although they have all ſang to us, that by divine Providence and a Miracle, the more 'tis extended with the Child, the thicker it grows, which is abſolutely falſe; it being only true, that it is at that time a little thicker at the place where the Burthen cleaves, where its ſubſtance is then as it were ſpongious; but every where elſe it is very thin, and becomes the more ſo by how much it is more extended, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:171433:174"/>
being emptied by the Birth of the Child, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to grow thicker in contracting and gathering to it ſelf all its ſubſtance, which was before very much extended. It being juſt like the Bladder which being full is very thin, and being empty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us of half a Fingers thickneſs, which filling again waxeth thinner in proportion to the Urine that flows to it: having then ſo opened the Womb, he muſt likewiſe make an inciſion in the Infants Membranes, taking care not to wound it with the inſtrument, and then he will ſoon ſee it, and muſt immediatly take it out with the Burthen, which he muſt nimbly ſeparate from the bottom of the Womb; and finding it to be yet living, let him praiſe God for having ſo bleſſed and proſpered his Operation.</p>
               <p>But the Children ſo delivered in theſe caſes are uſually ſo weak, (if not quite dead, as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens) that 'tis hard to know, whether 'tis alive or dead. Yet one may be confident the Child is living, if by touching the Navelſtring the <hi>Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Arteries are perceived to move, as alſo the Heart, by laying the Hand on the Breaſt; and if it prove ſo, means muſt be uſed to fetch it to it ſelf, ſpout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Wine in the Noſe and Mouth, warming it until it begins to ſtir of it ſelf. Midwives uſually lay the Burthen very hot on the Belly of ſuch weak Children; if that helps, 'tis rather becauſe of the temperate heat of it, than for any other cauſe: for 'tis impoſſible the Infant ſhould receive any ſpirits from it, after it is once ſeparated from the Womb, and yet leſs when the Woman is dead. As to the heat of it, it can no wiſe hurt, but the weight of this maſs layed on the Belly, may rather

choak it, by the compreſſion it makes, than do it any good; beſides, when the Burthen is grown cold, they put it in a Skellet of hot Wine, from whence they think the Spirits renew, which being conveyed through the String into the Childs Belly, gives it new force: but as I have ſaid already, that is very uſeleſs, and the beſt and ſpeedieſt remedy is immediatly to ſeparate it, and open the Childs Mouth, cleaning and unſtopping alſo the Noſe, if there be any filth, to help it ſo to breath freely, keeping it all the while near the Fire, until it hath a little recovered its weakneſs, ſpouting ſome Wine into the Noſe and Mouth of it, that he may a little taſt and ſcent it, which can not hurt it in this juncture, if one obſerves ſome moderation in the thing.</p>

            <p>GOing with Child is an rough Sea, on which a big-bellyed Woman and her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant floats the ſpace of nine Months: And Labour, which is the only Port, is ſo full of dangerous Rocks, that very often both the one and the other, after they are arrived and diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked, have yet need of much help to defend them againſt divers inconveniences, that uſually follow the Pains and Travail they have undergone in it.</p>
            <p>We have directed in the Firſt Book, treating of the Diſeaſes which are incident to Women with Child, how to prevent their ſuffering ſhipwrack in this Sea during ſo long a Voyage. In the Second we have taught, how they may enter this Port, and diſimbarque there with ſafety by Delivery: It remains then to compleat our work, that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound in this Third and laſt, how the Mother and Child muſt afterwards be ordered, and declare how at this time to prevent and remedy divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions

               <p>IMmediatly after the Woman is delivered, and the Burthen come away, care muſt be taken that the looſening of it be not followed with a Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which if it be not, a ſoft Cloſure to the Womb muſt immediatly be applied, five or ſix double, to prevent the cold Air by entring in, from ſudden ſtopping the Veſſels, by which the Woman ſhould cleanſe by degrees, whereby there would certainly happen many ill accidents, as great Pains and Gripes of the Belly, Inflammation of the Womb, and divers others which we ſhall mention hereafter particularly, and which may eaſily be the cauſe of her death.</p>
               <p>When the Womb is ſo cloſed, if the Woman was not delivered upon her ordinary Bed, let her be preſently carried into it by ſome ſtrong body, or more if there be need, rather than to let her walk thither; which Bed muſt be firſt ready warmed and prepared as is requiſite, becauſe of the cleanſings; but if ſhe were delivered on it (which is beſt and ſafeſt to prevent the danger and trouble
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:171433:176"/>
of carrying her to it) then all the ſoul linnen and other things put there for the receiving the Blood, Waters, and other Filth which comes away in Labour, muſt be preſently removed, and ſhe muſt be placed conveniently in it for her eaſe and reſt, which ſhe much wants, to recover her of the Pains and Labour ſhe endured during her Travail; that is, with her Head and Body a little raiſed, for to breath the freer and cleanſe the better, eſpecially of that Blood which then comes away, that ſo it may not clod, which being retained cauſes very great Pains. All this will happen, if they have not liberty to come freely by this convenient ſcituation, in which ſhe muſt put down her Legs and Thighs cloſe together, having a ſmall Pillow (for her greater eaſe if ſhe deſire it) under her Hams, upon which they may reſt a little: being ſo put to Bed, let her lye neither of one ſide nor the other, but juſt on the middle of her back, that ſo the Womb may repoſſeſs its natural and proper place.</p>
               <p>It is an ordinary cuſtom to give the Women, aſſoon as they are delivered, two Ounces of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, drawn without fire, and as much Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of <hi>Maiden-hair,</hi> mixed together, which is as well for to ſweeten and temper the inſide of the Throat, which was heated and hoarſe by her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Cries, and holding her Breath to bear down her Throws during her Labour, as alſo to the end that her Stomach and Inteſtines being lined with it, ſhould not be ſo much afflicted with dolorous Gripes: But this Potion goes ſo much againſt the Stomachs of ſome Women, that being forced to take it with an averſion and diſguſt, it may do them rather more hurt, than any wiſe comfort
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:171433:177"/>
them. Wherefore let none have it but thoſe that deſire it, and have no averſion to it. I approve rather in this caſe of a good Broth to be given her, aſſoon as ſhe is a little ſetled after the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Labour; becauſe it will be both more pleaſing and profitable than ſuch a Potion. And, having thus accommodated her, and provided for her Belly, Breaſts and lower parts, after the manner we ſhall direct in the next Chapter, leave her to reſt and ſleep if ſhe can, making no noiſe, the Bed-curtains being cloſe drawn, and the Doors and Windows of her Chamber ſhut, that ſo ſeeing no light, ſhe may the ſooner fall aſleep. If ſhe had endured a hard Labour, ſhe muſt be then ordered as the caſe requires, and as ſhall be hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: but what we have here directed, is only for a natural Labour, and where no extraordinary difficulty happens.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of convenient Remedies for the lower parts of the Belly and Breaſts of Women newly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</head>
               <p>SInce the lower parts of a Woman are greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended by the birth of an Infant, it is good to endeavour therefore the prevention of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation there: wherefore aſſoon as the Bed is cleanſed from the foul linnen and other impurities of the Labour, and that the Woman is therein
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:171433:177"/>
placed, according to the direction of the preceding Chapter, let there be outwardly applied all over the bottom of her Belly, and Privities, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Anodine Cataplaſm,</hi> made of two Ounces of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, with two or three new-laid Eggs, Yolks and Whites, ſtirring them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an earthen Pipkin over hot Embers, till it comes to the conſiſtence of a Pultiſs, which being ſpread upon a Cloth, muſt be applied to thoſe parts, indifferently warm, having firſt taken away the Cloſures, which were put to her preſently after her Delivery, and likewiſe ſuch clods of Blood as were there left.</p>
               <p>This is a very temperate remedy, and fit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the Pains which Women ordinarily ſuffer in thoſe parts, becauſe of the violence then endured by the Infants Birth: it muſt lie on five or ſix Hours, and then be renewed a ſecond time if there be occaſion, afterwards make a Decoction of Barley, Linſeed, and Chervil; or with Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows and Violet leaves, adding to a Pint of it, an ounce of Honey of Roſes, with which, being luke warm, foment three or four times a day (for the firſt five or ſix days of Child-bed) the bearing-place, cleanſing it very well from the Blood, Clods and other Excrements which are there em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied. This <hi>Stupe</hi> is likewiſe very good to temper and appeaſe the Pains of thoſe parts. Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only uſe to this purpoſe luke-warm Milk; and many Women, only Barley-water. Great care muſt be taken at the beginning that no ſtopping things be given to hinder the cleanſings, but when <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>twelve</hi> days are paſt, and that ſhe hath cleanſed very ſufficiently, Remedies may then be
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:171433:178"/>
uſed to fortifie the parts, to which purpoſe a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction is very proper, made of Provence-Roſes, Leaves and Roots of <hi>Plantane,</hi> and Smiths water that Iron is quenched in; and when ſhe hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently and fully done Cleanſing, which is uſually after the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, there may be made for thoſe that deſire it, a very ſtrong aſtringent Lotion, to fortifie and ſettle thoſe parts, which have been much relaxed, as well by the great extenſion they received, as by the humours with which they have been ſo long time ſoaked. This Remedy may be compoſed with an Ounce and an half of <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate</hi> Peel, an Ounce of <hi>Cypreſs</hi> Nuts, half an Ounce of Acorns, an Ounce of <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> a Handful of <hi>Provence</hi>-Roſes, and two drachms of <hi>Roch-Allum:</hi> all which being infuſed a whole night in five half Pints of ſtrong red Wine, or (that it may not be too ſharp) a quantity of Smiths water mixed with that Wine; afterwards boil it well to a Quart, then ſtrain it, ſqueezing of it ſtrongly, and with this Decoction foment thoſe inferiour parts Nights and Mornings, to the end they may as much as poſſible be ſtrengthened and confirmed: I ſay as much as poſſible; becauſe there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that they can ever be reduced to the ſame eſtate they were in before ſhe had Children. So much for this: Wee'l now paſs to convenient Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the Belly of a new-laid Woman.</p>
               <p>All Authors do appoint, immediatly after Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the skin of a black Sheep ſlaid alive, for this purpoſe, to be laid all over her Belly, and to lie on four or five Hours; others will have a Hare-skin. Truly I believe that by reaſon of the natural heat of ſuch Skins, the remedy is not bad: but I alſo fear
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:171433:178"/>
leſt in ſome ſmall time after it may do the Woman more hurt than good, and that by its Moiſtneſs, cooling of her, it may make her to ſhake, which would be very prejudicial in ſtopping her Cleanſings, which ought to flow; beſides it is a remedy or too much trouble; for there muſt always be a Butcher ready for every Woman that is laid, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon that can do it as readily, who muſt be for this purpoſe in the very Chamber, or at leaſt in the Houſe, that ſo they may have the Skin very hot according to directions.</p>
               <p>They likewiſe direct a ſmall Plaiſter of <hi>Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> with a little Civet in the middle, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Womans Navil, which as they imagine is very proper to keep the Womb in its place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being delighted with that ſmell, it drawes neer to it of its ſelf, but this remedy is a little<note n="*" place="margin">Practice and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs commends it, nor is there reaſon wanting to defend it: wherefore not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Authors ſenſe, it may be ſucceſsfully continued.</note> Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious: wherefore I am not for it, it being ſufficient to keep the Belly very warm, in the ſituation we have directed, and prevent the leaſt cold.</p>
               <p>As for Swaths convenient to a Woman new laid, they need not be us'd the firſt day, or at leaſt but very looſely, eſpecially when there hath been a hard Labour; becauſe the leaſt compreſſion of the Womans Belly, which is then very ſore, as the Womb alſo is, having been much harraſſed, proves a great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to her, wherefore let her not be ſwathed until the Second day, and that very gently at the beginning. Midwives believe that they ſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:171433:179"/>
of Boulſter, as well for the keeping the Womb up in its place, as to ſqueeze out from all parts the Cleanſings which are neceſſary to be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated: And Nurſekeepers, abuſed with this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, do ſometimes ſwath their Bellies ſo ſtrait, that they do bruiſe the Womb, which is very painful in the beginning of Child-bed, and from whence often follows very dangerous Inflamations.</p>
               <p>Theſe Swaths and Boulſters can have no hold to ſupport the Womb as they imagine, foraſmuch as its<note n="*" place="margin">Bottom of the Womb.</note> Fund, which is the principal part being flitting in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the<note n="†" place="margin">Lower Belly.</note> 
                  <hi>Hypogaſter,</hi> cannot be kept ſtable and firm by that which is applied upon the Belly, and beſide the interpoſition of the Bladder which is upon it, will not permit it.</p>
               <p>As to their opinion that ſuch Swathings help to cleanſe the Womb, 'tis fit they ſhould be diſabuſed of this Error; for it is not the ſame thing in theſe Cleanſings, as preſſing the juice out of boil'd meat in a Napkin, for theſe are wholly a work of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which a ſtrong compreſſion (inſtead of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) hinders, by the pain it cauſes to the Womb, and the Inflamations that follow. Without dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling then upon the ordinary manner of Swathing, let us be guided according to the dictates of Reaſon, and not according to the Nurſ-keepers naughty Cuſtoms, whoſe Method is firſt to put upon the Belly a Swath four or five double, of a triangular Figure, to ſupport (as they pretend) the Womb, and ſometimes two others Roulers very ſtrait, on each ſide towards the Groine, to keep it in its place, leſt it be ſhaken, and encline more to one ſide than
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:171433:179"/>
t'other, with yet another broad ſquare Swath for the whole Belly, which they put upon the firſt, afterwards they make a Swath of a Napkin folded two or three double, of the breadth of a quarter of an Ell, with which they do very much girt and compreſs the Belly.</p>
               <p>I do very well approve of the uſe of theſe Swaths, and of a good large ſquare Boulſter over the whole Belly, provided they be very looſe the firſt ſeven or eight daies, only to keep it a little ſteady, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving in the mean time to take it off, and remove it often, to anoint the Womans Belly all over (if it be ſore, and that ſhe have After-Pains) with Oile of ſweet Almonds and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Johns</hi> Wort mixed together, which may be done every day: But after that time, they may by degrees begin to ſwath her ſtraighter, to contract and gather together the parts, which were greatly extended during her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Child, which may be then very ſafely done; becauſe the Womb by thoſe former clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings is ſo diminiſhed and leſſened, that it cannot be too much compreſſed by the Swaths. Let us now ſee what is fit to be done to the Breaſts.</p>
               <p>Proper Remedies may be applied to them, for to drive back the Milk, if the Woman will not be a Nurſe, of which we ſhall ſpeak hereafter; but if ſhe intends to be a Nurſe, 'twill be ſufficient to keep her Breaſts very cloſe, and well covered with gentle and ſoft Clothes, for to keep them warm, leſt the Milk curdle in them; and if there be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of too much Blood being carried thither, anoint the Breaſts with Oile of Roſes, and a little Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar beat together, and put upon them ſome fine Linnen dipt in it, obſerving that if the Woman
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:171433:180"/>
do ſuckle her Child, ſhe gives it not the Breaſt the ſame day ſhe is brought to Bed, becauſe then all her Humours are extremely moved with the Pains and agitation of the Labour; wherefore let her defer it at leaſt till next day, and it would be yet better to ſtay four or five days, or longer, to the end the fury of the Milk and the abundance of humours, which flow to the Breaſts in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be ſpent, in which time another Woman may give it ſuck. Let us now diſcourſe of a fit Diet for the Woman to keep, during her whole Child-bed.</p>

               <p>ALthough a Woman be naturally delivered, yet notwithſtanding ſhe muſt obſerve a good Diet, to prevent many ill accidents, which may happen to her during her Child-bed; at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of which ſhe muſt be directed in her Meat and Drink, almoſt as if ſhe had a Fever, that ſo it may be prevented, inaſmuch as ſhe is then very ſubject to it; ſo likewiſe it often happens to her by the leaſt neglect committed towards her in her tending.</p>
               <p>For this Reaſon one muſt not be of the opinion
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:171433:180"/>
of many Nurſe-keepers, who will have a new-laid Woman to be well fed, as well to reſtore her loſt ſtrength, by the tediouſneſs of the Labour, and by the quantity of Blood then evacuating, for which cauſe they believe the Woman muſt be well nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed to make more Blood, as alſo to fill up her Belly, which is very much emptied by the Birth of the Child: but it is much better to follow in this the counſel which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> gives us in his Tenth Aphoriſm of the Second Book, where he ſaies, <hi>Impura corpora quo plus nutriveris, eo magis laeſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> The more you nouriſh impure Bodies, the more you hurt them. Now it is certain that a Woman newly delivered is of this ſort, as you may know by the quantity of Cleanſings and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities which flow from her Womb at this time, when for this reaſon they muſt be very regular in their Diet, eſpecially the three or four firſt daies, in which time ſhe muſt be nouriſhed only with good Broaths, new laid Eggs, and Jellies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing at the beginning more ſolid Meats; but when the great abundance of her Milk is a little paſt, ſhe may with more ſafety eat a little Broath at her Dinner, or a ſmall piece of boil'd Chicken, or Mutton, as ſhe likes beſt; afterwards, if no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident happens, they may by degrees nouriſh her more plentifully, provided in the mean time, that it be a third part leſs than ſhe was accuſtomed to take in her perfect Health, and that her Food be of good and eaſie digeſtion; not ſuffering her to eat any of thoſe Cakes, Tarts, or other Paſtries, which are uſually provided at the Childs Baptiſm. As for her Drink, let it be <hi>Ptyſan, [which is Liquoriſh, Figs and Aniſeeds boiled in Water]</hi> or at leaſt boil'd
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:171433:181"/>
Water, being careful not to give it her too cold; ſhe may alſo (provided ſhe be not Feaveriſh) drink a little white Wine, well mixed with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but not till after the firſt Five or Six days.</p>
               <p>Although I preſcribe this Rule in general for all thoſe who are newly brought to Bed; yet there are ſome who muſt not obſerve it ſo exactly as laborious Women, who being of a very ſtrong and rebuſt conſtitution, require a more plentiful feeding, to whom notwithſtanding, if they do not change the quality, they muſt at leaſt retrench the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of their ordinary food, having alwaies reſpect to what every perſon accuſtom themſelves to, which the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> doth likewiſe teach us in the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Aphoriſm of the firſt Book, where he ſaith, <hi>Animadvertendi ſunt quibus ſemel aut bis, &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus copioſior aut parcior aut per partes Cibus eſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendus, dandum verò aliquid tempori, regioni, aerati, &amp; conſuetudini.</hi> 
                  <q>Great care and notice muſt be taken to whom to give meat once only or twice; as alſo to whom to give more, or to whom leſs, or by little and little; but ſome allowance muſt be made in reſpect of Time, Countrey, Age and Cuſtome.</q> What we have already ſaid ſhall ſuffice for direction in their Meat and Drink.</p>
               <p>The Child-bed Woman muſt likewiſe keep her ſelf very quiet in her Bed, lying on her Back, with her Head a little raiſed, and not turning often from ſide to ſide, that ſo the <hi>Matrix</hi> may be the better ſetled in its firſt Scituation: ſhe muſt free her ſelf at that time from all care of buſineſs, leaving it to the management of ſome of her Kindred or Friends; let her talk as little as may be, and that with a low voice, and let no ill news be brought
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:171433:181"/>
to her, which may affect her; becauſe all theſe things do cauſe ſo great a commotion or perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Humours, that Nature not being able to overcome them, cannot make the neceſſary eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of them, which hath been the death of many.</p>
               <p>The Citizens Wives have a very ill Cuſtom, which they would do very well to refrain, that is, they cauſe their Children to be baptized the ſecond or third day after their Labour; at which time all their Relations and Friends have a Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Child-bed Room, with whom ſhe is obliged to diſcourſe, and make anſwers to the Goſſips and all Comers a whole After-noon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the uſual Complements of thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, enough to diſtract her; and though there is ſcarce any of the Company which do not drink her Health, yet by the noiſe they make in her Ears, ſhe loſes it: beſides all this, ſhe is often conſtrained, out of reſpect, to forbear the uſe of her Bed-pan and other neceſſaries, which are very prejudicial to her: and this happens juſt at the time when ſhe ought to have moſt reſt; becauſe about the third day the Milk flowes in greateſt quantity to the Breaſts; this is the reaſon why ordinarily the next day they have a very great Feaver. She ought alwaies to keep her Body open with Clyſters, taking one once in two daies, which not only evacuate the groſs Excrements, but alſo by drawing downwards cauſe her to cleanſe the better. When ſhe hath obſerved this Rule a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night or three weeks, which is very near the time of having cleanſed ſufficiently, that thoſe parts may be throughly cleanſed before ſhe goes abroad, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:171433:182"/>
begins upon a New ſcore; let her take a gentle Purge made of <hi>Senna, Caſſia,</hi> Syrup of <hi>Succory</hi> with <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> which is good to purge the Stomach and Bowels of thoſe ill Humours, Nature could not evacuate by the Womb, as it did the other Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities; this Purge may be repeated if neceſſary: all which being done, and that no indiſpoſition remain, ſhe may bath once or twice, or to waſh and cleanſe her Body, and afterwards ſhe may govern her ſelf according to her former Cuſtome.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> How to drive back the Milk in thoſe Women who are not willing to give ſuck.</head>
               <p>THere are many Remedies uſed to this purpoſe, ſome of which hinder the afflux of humours to the Breaſt, and others diſſipate and in part diſſolve the Milk therein contained.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which hinder the Humours from plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully flowing thither, are Oile of Roſes well mixt with Vinegar, with which the Breaſts are to be anointed all over; or <hi>Unguentum Populeum,</hi> with <hi>Ceratum refrigerans Galeni,</hi> equally mixt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon a piece of Linnen, or gray Paper, and ſo applyed to the Breaſts. Others uſe Linnen dipt in luke-warm Verjuce, in which a little Allom is diſſolved, that ſo it may be more Aſtringent; and others lay to them the Lees of Red Wine alone, or mixt with Oyl of Roſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:171433:182"/>Thoſe Remedies which diſſolve and diſſipate the Milk from the Breaſt is a <hi>Cataplaſme</hi> of the four<note n="*" place="margin">Of Linſeed Fenugreek, Beans, and Fitches.</note> Branns, Honey and Saffron, boiled with the Decoction of Chervil or Sage.</p>
               <p>Others apply Honey only, and ſome others rub the Breaſt alone with Honey, and put upon it the Leaves of Red-Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badg, the great Stalks firſt being taken away, and they a little deadned before the fire; this remedy doth very readily drive away the Milk.</p>
               <p>There are ſome which boil <hi>Sage</hi> and <hi>Box</hi> Leaves in Urine, with which they do foment the Breaſts pretty warm, and lay a Cloth upon them dipt in it. But great care muſt be taken in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and change of theſe things, that the Woman catch not the leaſt cold, as alſo that no Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Impoſtumation be cauſed, inſtead of driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the Milk: Wherefore ſuch Remedies are to be choſen as are reſtraining, repercuſſive, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, according to the different diſpoſitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>I know ſome Women who hold it for a very great ſecret, and moſt certain and fit to drive the Milk effectually back; and that is to put on her Husbands ſhift yet warm, immediatly after he hath taken it off, and wear it until the Milk be gone: but in caſe the Milk doth in the mean time vaniſh, 'tis ſuperſtitious to believe that this Shirt is the cauſe of it, and that it can produce ſuch an effect; it happens rather, becauſe all the humours of the Body of their own accord taking another courſe than to the Breaſts, do not daily flow in ſo great abundance to them: Wherefore in the uſe of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:171433:183"/>
all theſe Remedies, the principal muſt not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, which is, to take care that they tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, procuring to that purpoſe a good and ample evacuation of the<note n="*" place="margin">Cleanſings.</note> 
                  <hi>Lochia,</hi> which is much furthered by keeping the Belly open by Clyſters provoking them, in doing whereof the Milk will ſoon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
               <p>All that we have ſaid in the former Chapters of this Third Book, is only to be obſerved when the new-laid Woman hath no manner of Indiſpoſition, for in caſe that any happen, ſhe muſt be governed in another manner, and according as the Accidents require, of which we intend now to treat in the following Chapters.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of ſeveral Diſeaſes and Symptomes which happen to a Woman new laid, and firſt of Flooding.</head>
               <p>WE have elſewhere mentioned the Flooding which precedes Labour, and ſhewed the only means to remedy it, which is to deliver the Woman aſſoon as poſſible; let us now ſee what is fit to be done to that which happens immediatly, or in a little time after, proceeding from the late opening of the orifices of the Veſſels of the Womb, by the looſening of the <hi>Secondine</hi> which cleaved to it: this Blood flowes then ſo much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:171433:183"/>
by how much it is ſubtiler and hotter, or by the agitation of a long and hard Labour, and beſides when a Woman is Sanguine or Plethorick.</p>
               <p>This Accident may often happen by a too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or violent pulling away of the After-Burthen, and ſometimes from ſome part of it being left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the Womb, or elſe ſome falſe Conception; which then endeavouring to expel, it preſſes and forceth forth the Blood out of the Veſſels newly opened, and ſometimes a great Clod of Blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the bottom of the Womb will produce the ſame effect, which by reaſon of the diſtention it often cauſes, excites Pains like to thoſe a Woman endures before Labour, and doth not ceaſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting her, until ſhe hath voided it, and then ſhe is at eaſe; but ſometimes the Blood continuing ſtill to flow, and remaining in the bottom of the Womb, becomes new Clods; which is the cauſe why the accident renews again as before, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth ſo by fits, in the intervals of which there comes away ſome Seroſities of the Blood retained, which diſſolves; and makes ſome perſons, ignorant of the Art, to think that the Flux is ſtopt, although it ſtill continues flowing within, where it ſtops only by ſome blood ſo coagulated; but when this Clod comes away the Flooding begins again, pure Blood and in great abundance.</p>
               <p>Flooding is a more dangerous Accident than any other which may happen to a Woman newly laid, and which diſpatches her ſo ſoon, if it be in great quantity, that there is not often time to prevent it. Wherefore in this caſe convenient Remedies muſt be ſpeedily applied, as well to ſtop it, as to turn it back from the places whence it flowes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:171433:184"/>To which purpoſe 'tis fit to conſider what cauſeth this Flooding, and if it be a falſe Conception, piece of the Burthen, or clodded Blood remaining behind, all diligence muſt be uſed to fetch them away, or to cauſe a ſpeedy expulſion of them; but if when nothing remains behind in the Womb, the Blood doth notwithſtanding continue to flow, you muſt bleed the Woman in the Arm, not ſo much thereby to empty the fulneſs, as to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; let her Body be laid equally flat, and not raiſed, that ſo the Blood may not be ſent down to the lower parts; let her keep her ſelf very quiet, without turning from ſide to ſide, that ſo the Humours may not be ſtirred, the upper part of her Belly muſt likewiſe not be ſwathed or boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, for ſuch ſtraitneſs augmens the evil; let her Chamber be kept a little cool, and let her not be too warm covered in her Bed, that ſo the flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through Heat may not be continued. All the world forbids Clyſters in this caſe, leſt, as they ſay, the humours be drawn down in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; but I have twice experimentally found the contrary, where great Floodings have been ſtopt by Clyſters, of which I will give you a particular account, that ſo it may be uſeful on the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>I was three years ſince called to a Woman, who was ſurprized with a very great Flooding imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after the Midwife had delivered her, which ſhe had done with too much violence, as the good Woman aſſured me; who told me, She felt a very great pain at the inſtant ſhe pull'd away the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, and that ſhe perceived at the looſening of it a Crack: Now from the moment that ſhe was ſo
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:171433:184"/>
delivered, ſhe loſt, for five or ſix daies continually, ſo great abundance of Blood, that I could ſcarce believe ſhe could without dying, had I not ſeen it my ſelf: during all this time they had to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe uſed all the means they could imagine to ſtop this accident, and becauſe with it ſhe complained of great pains in her Belly, they gave her <hi>Anodine</hi> and cooling Clyſters, for fear leſt giving her others more ſtrong, the Flooding would be more and more excited: She had taken ſo four or five Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which came away as they were given, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Excrement; which ſeeing, and judging that aſſuredly ſome groſs Excrements (being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Inteſtines from before the time of her Labour, which could not be evacuated by theſe <hi>Anodine</hi> Clyſters) did cauſe ſo great a Chollick, which ſhe felt all over her Belly, which appeared puft up; I cauſed her to take one common and one pretty ſtrong Clyſter, contrary however to the opinion of moſt perſons, who not knowing the cauſe of the diſtemper, bade me have a care leſt it ſhould, as they ſaid, cauſe a greater Flooding; but the iſſue of it was quite otherwiſe than they expected; for the good Woman voided with this Clyſter a Pan full of groſs Excrements, which having ſtaid there a long time, and being thereby hardened, had ſtopt the Paſſage of much Wind, which paſſed away at this time. Now the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines full of this groſs matter, being every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agitated by this Wind, did likewiſe agitate and continually compreſs the Womb, by means of which the Flooding was always maintained, which did ceaſe immediatly after this Chollck was diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the evacuation of theſe Excrements; and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:171433:185"/>
ſince that time being again called upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of loſs of Blood, proceeding from the ſame cauſe, and having taken the ſame courſe, the iſſue of it was likewiſe the ſame. Wherefore if there be the leaſt appearance of Excrements contained in the Inteſtines, make no ſcruple to give Clyſters to evacuate them, forbearing in this caſe thoſe that are Aſtringent, becauſe they harden and retain yet more that which augments the diſtemper.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the bearing down, and falling out of the Womb and Fundament of a Woman new-laid.</head>
               <p>I Shall, the better to explain the thing, make two ſorts of Bearings down or Relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as alſo two ſorts of Fallings forth, or Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Womb; all which differ but in the degree, according as they fall down more or leſs: for the Relaxation is when the Womb only bears down and comes not forth; and the Precipitation is, when it comes out of the Body.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſort of Bearing down is that, in which the whole body of the Womb falls into the <hi>Vagina,</hi> in ſuch manner, that putting up the Finger, one may feel the orifice very neer. The ſecond ſort of Bearing down is, when the Womb being yet lower, one can manifeſtly perceive this Orifice quite without.</p>
               <p>The Falling-out is alſo of two ſorts; in the firſt the Womb comes quite forth, but is not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned inſide out, nor can the inſide of it be ſeen, but
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:171433:187"/>
only its Orifice, which appears at the end of a great fleſhy maſs, which makes the body of the Womb; and this is called <hi>Prolapſus Uteri,</hi> that is, A falling forth of the Womb. And the other falling out, of all is moſt dangerous, and is called <hi>Perverſio,</hi> or turning inſide out; for then it is not only fallen forth, but the bottom of it is turned quite out, that ſo you may perceive it all even, and without an Orifice; becauſe it is ſo turned. The Womb turned on this faſhion appears to be only a great piece of bloody fleſh, (and almoſt like the<note n="*" place="margin">A mans Cod.</note> 
                  <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>) which hangs between the Womans Thighs; and that which is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this caſe is, that the Infants houſe, which is the Womb, goes forth at the Gate, which is the inner Orifice.</p>
               <p>The Bearing down of the Womb proceeds either from a Relaxation or Ruption of the Ligaments. Women that have abundance of the <hi>Whites,</hi> are ſubject to theſe Relaxations, and the Ligaments are extended or broken by hard and violent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as alſo by too frequent bearing of great and heavy Children, ſometimes by a great Cough, by ſtrong and frequent Sneezings, or having leaped or fallen from high places, by going in a Coach, Cart, on Horſ-back, or in other rude and ſhaking Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; by having lifted up beyond their ſtrength heavy burthens, by lifting up the Arms too much, and putting them over the Head; by a tedious looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with great Pains and Needing; foraſmuch as all theſe things do ſhake and extremely thruſt the Womb downwards when it is with Child, and the Ligaments being by this means looſened or broken
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:171433:187"/>
cannot keep it up any longer, which is the cauſe that a bearing down doth eaſily follow the birth of a Child; but the moſt ordinary cauſe of theſe Bearings down, or fallings out of the Womb, is violent and hard Travails, which uſually happens when a Child comes wrong, ſo that it cannot be born, and when it hath too big a Head, or when the inner Orifice is not dilated ſufficiently for to give it paſſage at that time, for the Womb is then forced down with ſo much violence, and yet the Child cannot advance into the Paſſage, becauſe the Ligaments are extremely rent or looſened, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when the <hi>Secondine</hi> cleaving cloſely to the bottom of the Womb is pulled away of a ſudden, or with too much violence, and much the ſooner, if that putting up the Hand into it (as it is neceſſary when the String is broke) one takes hold and pulls the body of the Womb itſelf, inſtead of the After-birth. We have, in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of the <hi>Second</hi> Book, given ſuch directions as will prevent this miſtake, and bring it away ſafely.</p>
               <p>A Woman troubled with this falling out of the Womb feels a great weight at the bottom of her Belly, with an extreme pain in her Reins and Loins towards the place where theſe Ligaments are faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and a reddiſh bloody moiſture is perceived to paſs through this maſs of Fleſh which hangs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her Legs. A Relaxation may happen to all ſorts of Women from any of the cauſes above mentioned; but a falling out but ſeldom, and a perfect Perverſion never but upon a Delivery, or immediatly after; becauſe then the inner Orifice is almoſt as wide as the bottom of it, which is not ſo at other times, when being cloſed, there is no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:171433:188"/>
for it to be thus turned inſide out. I have ſhown in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of the <hi>Second</hi> Book, how to prevent this Accident at the time of Labour in a Woman that is ſubject to it; to which place you may have recourſe to avoid repetition.</p>
               <p>If a ſpeedy remedy be applied to the Relaxation and falling out of the Womb, by reducing and remitting it into its natural place, a Cure may be eaſily expected; and ſo much the rather, by how much the Woman is young, and the Malady freſh: but if ſhe be old, and this Diſeaſe be already of a long ſtanding, ſhe is ſo much the more incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>For the Cure of this diſtemper regard muſt be had to two things; the Firſt is, to reduce the Womb into its natural place, and the Second is to ſtrengthen it, and keep it there.</p>
               <p>For the execution of the firſt, which is to reduce it, if the Womb be quite out, or turned, the Woman muſt firſt of all be made to render her Urine, and a Clyſter muſt be given her, if it be neceſſary, for to empty the groſs Excrements that are in the <hi>Rectum,</hi> that ſo the reduction may be the eaſier performed; then place her on her Back, with her Hips raiſed a little higher than her Head, and then foment all that is fallen forth with a little Wine and Water luke-warm, and having taken a ſoft Rag, put it up into its proper place, thruſting it back, not all at once, but wagging it by little and little from ſide to ſide; and in caſe this be too painful, becauſe it is already too big, and ſwelled, anoint it with Oile of ſweet Almonds, for the more eaſie reduction of it, being careful aſſoon as it is reduced, to wipe off the Oile as much as may be, to
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:171433:188"/>
avoid a Relapſe. But if notwithſtanding all this the Womb cannot be put up, becauſe it is very much enflamed and tumefied, which happens when it hath been a long time ſo, without the uſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means, during which time it is continually moiſtened with Urine and other Excrements, which contribute very much to its corruption; in this caſe there is great danger that it will gangrene, and be afterwards the death of the Woman. There have however ſome Women eſcaped this accident; <hi>Pareus</hi> recites the Hiſtory of ſuch an one, which <hi>Rouſſet</hi> doth alſo amongſt his <hi>Caeſarean</hi>-births; but this happens very rarely.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond part of this Cure which conſiſts in the retention of the Womb in its place, and the ſtrengthening of it ſo reduced, it will be done by a convenient ſcituation. Let the Woman for this purpoſe keep her ſelf in Bed on her back, having her Hips a little raiſed, her Legs ſomething croſſed, and her Thighs joined together, to prevent the falling of it out again; but the beſt way is to put up a Peſſary into the Neck of the Womb, for to keep it firm. There are two or three ſorts made for this purpoſe, the ſeveral Figures of which are at the beginning of this Chapter. Some are round and a little longiſh, of the figure of an Egg, and of the length and bigneſs of the Neck of the Womb, where it muſt be left after that it is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into it; but theſe are often ſubject to fall out again, and are not ſo uſeful and convenient as the other, which are made of a piece of Cork, that they may be light. They ought to be of a thick circular figure, like to a ſmall wreath, and pierced with a pretty big hole in the middle, which ſerves
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:171433:189"/>
aſwel for the lodging, ſupporting and receiving of the inner orifice of the Womb, as for the giving paſſage to the ſuperfluous humours, which are thence evacuated. Theſe kind of Peſſaries muſt be covered with white Wax, that they may be more ſmooth and incapable of hurting the Woman that uſeth them: they muſt be pretty large, that they may be the eaſier kept when they are put up: they may alſo have a ſmall String faſtened to them, to pull them out at any time to clean: But this String is not ſo very neceſſary, becauſe they may be eaſily enough taken out with one Finger: they may be made ſome of them exactly round, and others ſomething of a ſquare Figure or triangular: the corners muſt be rounded or blunted. Theſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hold better, and fall not ſo eaſily forth as the round; but either the one or the other may be uſed, as ſhall be thought moſt fit.</p>
               <p>During the flowing of the <hi>Lochia</hi> from the Womb, nothing els muſt be uſed to ſtrengthen, but only to keep it ſo in its natural place; for aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Remedies proper for the prevention of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of it will very much prejudice the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by ſtopping of theſe evacuations; and above all it muſt be obſerved in this diſtemper, that the Womans Belly be not ſtrait ſwathed any more than for a ſtay only, in which many Midwives are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, believing they keep it the better in its place by how much they ſwath the Belly the ſtraiter, for by this ſtrong compreſſion of it they force the Womb yet more down. She muſt uſe the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan in Bed, &amp; lying along if poſſible when ſhe goes to Stool, keeping her hand all the while on the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of her Belly, to bear it up. But when the time of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:171433:189"/>
her Purgations is fully over, and that ſhe hath cleanſed very well, aſtringent Injections may be then uſed without danger; reſpect muſt likewiſe be had to the whole habit of the Body, to dry up the humours by an univerſal courſe; and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt not riſe out of her Bed in at leaſt five or ſix Weeks time, that ſo the Womb and its Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be reſtored and fortified in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Scituation.</p>
               <p>It happens alſo ſometimes that by the great Throwes the Woman endures at her Labour, the Fundament falls quite out; in this caſe, if the Child be very forward in the Paſſage, 'twill be ſufficient before this accident happens to hinder it if poſſible, perſuading the Woman not to help her Throwes ſo ſtrongly; but if it be already fallen down, they muſt ſtay till the Child be born ere it can be put up; for before that it will be difficult to do without much bruiſing the Inteſtine. Aſſoon then as the Woman is delivered, let it be reduced in the ſame manner as that of the Womb, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fomented, bathed and anointed it, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, forbearing afterwards during her Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the giving of her Clyſters, becauſe the force ſhe uſeth in rendring of them, will again cauſe the falling down of the Fundament.</p>

               <p>IT is no wonder that often, and eſpecially in firſt Labours, there happens bruiſes amd rents in the lower parts of a Woman; the cauſe of which is eaſily known, if the bigneſs of the Childs Head be but conſidered, which muſt needs make a great diſtention of thoſe ſtrait parts, by paſſing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the Womb; which parts, being thereby extremely preſſed againſt the hardneſs of the bones thar ſurround it, are eaſily bruiſed, and when they are not able to be ſufficiently dilated, they muſt neceſſarily be torn aſunder.</p>
               <p>Almoſt all Women in their firſt Labours do very much complain when the Child is in the Paſſage, that the Midwives prick and ſcratch thoſe parts, and do believe that the hurts and bruiſes which are there, after Labour, do happen becauſe the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives handled them too roughly; but they are very much miſtaken, for this comes becauſe the Childs Head in paſſing makes a violent diſtention and ſeparation of the four Caruncles and other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts which are bruiſed, and ſometimes rent by it; from hence ſpring the pains of which they then complain, as if they were pricked and ſcratched, whereof they are never after ſenſible in their following Labours, becauſe thoſe parts having once given way to an Infant, are ever after very

               <p>Theſe contuſions and rents muſt never be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, leſt they degenerate into malignant Ulcers; for the Heat and Moiſture of theſe parts, beſides the filth which continually flows thence, doth eaſily contribute towards it, if convenient Remedies be not timely applyed: Wherefore aſſoon as a Woman is laid, if there be only ſimple Contuſions and Exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations, apply the Cataplaſme formerly directed to thoſe lower parts to eaſe pain, made of the Yolks and Whites of new-laid Eggs and Oyl of Roſes ſeeth'd a little over warm Embers, continually ſtirring it till it be equally mixt, and then ſpread upon fine Cloth; it muſt be applyed very warm to the bearing-place for five or ſix hours; when, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, lay ſome fine Rags dipt in Oyl of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Johns-wort</hi> on each ſide the bearing-place, and renewing them twice or thrice a day, foment theſe parts with Barley Water and Honey of Roſes, to cleanſe them from the Excrements which paſs; and when the Woman makes Water, let them be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with fine Rags, to hinder the Urine from cauſing ſmarting and pain by touching them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Bruiſes are ſo great, that the Bearing-place is inflamed, and a very conſiderable Abſceſs follows, which I have met with; in which caſe it muſt be opened juſt below the ſwelling, in the moſt convenient place; and after the matter is evacuated, a <hi>Deterſive</hi> Injection muſt be injected into the Cavity, with the ſame Fomentation above-mentioned; <hi>viz.</hi> Barley-water and Oyl of Roſes, which may be a little heightned with Spirit of Wine, if there be any danger of Corruption, and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:171433:191"/>
afterwards the Ulcer muſt be dreſſed according to Art.</p>
               <p>But ſometimes it happens by an unlucky and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable accident, that the <hi>Perinaeum</hi> is rent, ſo that the Privity and Fundament is all in one; if it were ſo let alone without reunion, the Woman after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards happening to be with Child would indeed be delivered with more eaſe, and without danger of ſuffering the ſame again, as is uſual when healed after ſuch an accident; but likewiſe if it remains in this manner, 'tis ſo great an inconvenience, that her Ordure comes both waies. Wherefore having cleanſed the Womb, from ſuch Excrements as may be there, with red-Wine, let it be ſtrongly ſtitched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with three or four ſtitches or more, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the length of the ſeparation, and taking at each ſtitch good hold of the fleſh, that ſo it may not break out, and then dreſs it with an aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Balm, ſuch as is <hi>Linimentum Arcei,</hi> or the like, clapping a Plaiſter on, and ſome linnen above it, to prevent as much as may be the falling of the Urine and other Excrements upon it; becauſe their acrimony would make it ſmart, and put it to pain: and, that theſe parts may cloſe together with more eaſe, let the Woman keep her Thighs cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without the leaſt ſpreading, until the cure be perfected. But if afterwards ſhe happen to be with Child, ſhe will be obliged, to prevent the like miſchief, to anoint thoſe parts with emollient Oyls and Ointments; and when ſhe is in Labour, ſhe muſt forbear helping her Throws too ſtrongly at once, but leave Nature to perform it by degrees, together with the help of a Midwife well inſtructed in her Art, who being warned by the firſt diſgrace,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:171433:191"/>
will do her beſt to avoid a ſecond; for uſually when theſe parts have been once rent, it is very difficult to prevent the like in the following Travail; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scar there made doth ſtraighten the parts yet more; wherefore it were to be wiſhed for greater ſecurity againſt the like accident, that the Woman ſhould have no more Children.</p>
               <p>Now if by neglecting ſuch a rent, the Lips of it be cicatriced, and that Cure be deſired, you muſt with a good pair of Sciſſers cut off thoſe Scars in the ſame manner as is done in a Hare-lip, and it muſt afterwards be dreſt accordingly, or as if it newly happened.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of after-Pains which happen to a Woman new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid, and of their ſeveral cauſes.</head>
               <p>THe moſt common accident that uſually trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles moſt Women during their lying in, is after-Pains.</p>
               <p>We have formerly ſhewed how they are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to be prevented in giving the Woman im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after ſhe is laid two Ounces of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, drawn without fire, with as much Syrup of <hi>Maiden-hair;</hi> but ſince notwithſtanding this Remedy the Woman is much pained in her Belly, let us enquire what may be the cauſe of all theſe gripes, which are uſually called without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction After-pains, and are ſometimes felt about the Reins, Loins, and Groins, ſometimes in the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:171433:192"/>
Womb only, and ſometimes about the Navel and all over the Belly, either continually, or by fits with ſome remiſſion, in a certain place, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on one ſide and ſomtimes on another; all which reflections teach exactly their ſeveral cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and accordingly the Remedies muſt be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
               <p>The Pains of the Belly for the moſt part proceed from one only of theſe four cauſes, or ſeveral of them together; the firſt is by Wind contained in the Bowels, by which they are eaſily filled after Labour, as well becauſe they have more room to dilate then when the Child was in the Womb, by which they were compreſt, as alſo becauſe the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and matter contained as well in them as in the Stomach, have been ſo confuſed and agitated from ſide to ſide, during the pains of Labour, by the frequent Throws which alwaies much compreſs the Belly, that they could not be well digeſted, whence this wind is afterwards generated, and conſequently the Gripes which the Woman feels running in her Belly from ſide to ſide, according as the Wind moves more or leſs, and ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo towards the Womb, becauſe of the compreſſion and commotion which the Bowels make, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely thereby agitated.</p>
               <p>The Second Cauſe of theſe Gripes which torments the Woman as much as the former, is that which proceeds from ſome ſtrange body reſting in the Womb after Labour, which it endeavors to expel by continual Throws, and it is ſometimes a falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, or a piece of the Burthen, and very often clodded Blood which cauſe this torment, and never ceaſe til what is ſo contained in the Womb be come
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:171433:192"/>
away, theſe Pain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are very like the ſame that a Woman endures before ſhe is delivered, and are not abated by Clyſters, as thoſe are that proceed from Wind; but on the contrary are rather thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and augmented.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Theſe Pains are often cauſed by the ſudden ſuppreſſion of the<note n="*" place="margin">Childbed cleanſing.</note> 
                  <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi> which abundantly filling the whole ſubſtance of the Womb, cauſeth a great diſtention, and by its long ſtay an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which is communicated by means of the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum</hi> to all the parts of the lower Belly, by eaſon whereof it ſwells, and is extended, and grows ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hard, which accident continuing, very often kills the Woman in a ſhort time after.</p>
               <p>The Fourth and laſt cauſe of theſe Pains, is the great extenſion of the Ligaments of the Womb, by reaſon of a hard Labour; here they remain more fixt about the Reins, Loins and Groins than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part; becauſe they are the places where theſe Ligaments are faſtened, however theſe Pains do ſometimes communicate themſelves by continuity to the whole Womb, and the rather when it hath been bruiſed by a violent Labour.</p>
               <p>'Tis commonly held, that a Woman is not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with theſe Pains ſo much of her firſt Child, as of the following; but daily experience confirms us, that it happens indifferently, according as the preſent and various diſpoſitions contribute to it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or leſs, there being no certain rule in reſpect either to firſt or laſt Labours.</p>
               <p>All theſe Pains muſt be cured according to their ſeveral cauſes, and to prevent thoeſ which we ſay are excited by wind, give the Woman immediatly
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:171433:193"/>
after Delivery, Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and Syrup of <hi>Maiden-hair</hi> mixt together; ſome do more eſteem Oyl of Walnuts, provided it may be made of good Nuts, but this hath a worſe taſte than the other. This remedy ſerves to lenify and line the inſide of the Inteſtines with its Unctuouſneſs, by means whereof that which is contained within them paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away the eaſier; but, as we have ſaid elſewhere, this mixture is ſo nauſeous, that it doth often for that reaſon more hurt than good: wherefore I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a good warm Broth for thoſe who have an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Oyl. Others give half a glaſs of good Hippocras, but that (in the condition the Woman is in) may do more hurt, by cauſing a Fever. Now for the better preventing theſe kind of Pains, let the Woman keep her Belly very hot, and be careful not to drink her Drink too cold; and if they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her very much, hot Clothes from time to time muſt be laid on her Belly, or a Pan-cake fryed with Walnut-oyl may be applied to it, without ſwath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Belly too ſtrait: And for the better evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the wind out of the Inteſtines, give her a Clyſter, which may be repeated as often as neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires: but if by this means the pains of the Belly are not appeaſed, 'tis certain they are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſome other cauſe.</p>
               <p>If it be known that ſome ſtrange body is retained in the Womb, the expulſion of it muſt be procured, or it muſt be fetcht away by putting the Fingers into the Entry of it, according to the direction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given for the extracting of a falſe Conception; and if it be great Clods which (retained) do alſo cauſe theſe pains, they will not fail to ceaſe aſſoon as they are fetcht away; but alſo the ſame accident
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:171433:193"/>
will ſoon return, if new Blood flowes into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Womb, and coagulates there again, as it often happens; for it cannot endure to keep any thing in its capacity after the Childs birth.</p>
               <p>If the Womans Cleanſings be ſuddenly ſtopt, which a little before came down in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, you need not ſearch for any other cauſe of the pains ſhe endures; and the ſpeedieſt remedy is to bring them down, which is effected by Clyſters that draw downwards, by hot and aperitive Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations to the bearing place, and by bleeding in the Foot, preceded by that of the Arm, if the caſe require it.</p>
               <p>As to the Pains the Woman feels in her Loins and Groins, which come by reaſon of the great diſtention, or in part ruption of the Ligaments of the Womb thereabouts faſtened, reſt alone, and a good ſcituation of the body, will be ſufficient to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and reunite them without greater Medicines, becauſe they cannot be actually applied to the part affected, alwaies obſerving a good Diet; and not forgetting, in all theſe ſeveral ſorts of pains, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the natural evacuation of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> for 'tis one of the principal means to obtain a good iſſue.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the <hi>Lochia</hi> which flow from the Womb in Child-bed. Whence they come, and the Signs when they are good or bad.</head>
               <p>I Do not find that Authors have ſo ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the cauſe of the <hi>Lochia</hi> which are evacuated in Child-bed, as to make us truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what they are, either in reſpect of their Nature, affirming it to be the blood uſually purged away every Moneth before they were with Child, which being collected about the Womb, flowes away when it opens after the birth of the Child; or in reſpect of the quantity of this evacuation, and the length of time it ought to continue. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Naturâ Pueri,</hi> would have at the beginning an <hi>Hemine</hi> and an half a day; of which meaſure, though common in his time, we have no certain knowledg; for ſome will have it to be our half Pint, others a Pint or therebouts, and that they continue for a Male-child thirty daies, for a Female fourty, diminiſhing every day by little and little, until there comes no more, and the evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is compleated. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaies that theſe <hi>Lochia</hi> are only vitious humours, and the reſidue &amp; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of the Blood with which the Child was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risſhed in the Mothers Womb. But I will, as near
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:171433:194"/>
as I can, here deſcribe to you the manner how I conceive this evacuation to be made, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they diminiſh day by day, and change their colour, conſiſtence and quality according to the ſeveral times.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as the Child is born, there flowes away from the Womb, at the ſame moment, ſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh humours, beſides thoſe which came away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the breaking of the Membranes. Theſe Waters then are very often bloody, not that they are ſo by Nature, but becauſe there is for the moſt part Blood mixed with them, which comming from the Veſſels of the Womb, becauſe of the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and commotion they received in the Birth, become ſo reddiſh; but immediatly after the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then is compleatly looſened, then pure blood flows away; and the reaſon why theſe <hi>Lochia</hi> flow freely and are very red the firſt day, is, becauſe the Veſſels againſt which the Burthen was faſtened in the Womb are but newly opened; but the Blood flowing by little and little in leſs abundance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the greateſt plenitude hath been at firſt eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, doth clod in ſmall drops on the extremitie; of all thoſe Veſſels whereby they are ſtop'd, and then there comes away onely the moſt <hi>ſeroſe</hi> part of it; and therefore the <hi>Lochia</hi> begin the ſecond and third day to be more pale and leſs coloured, and after that the colour of them is leſs bloody every day, as the Veſſels cloſe, until they are at length very pale; which happens when the Veſſels being almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reunited, there diſtills only the meer moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of them, as alſo of the whole ſubſtance of the Womb, through which a quantity of it doth
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:171433:195"/>
likewiſe tranſude. Now theſe <hi>ſeroſe</hi> Humidities acquire by the heat of theſe places a conſiſtence ſomewhat thick, and that more or leſs, according as they come away in greater or leſſer quantity, and according to the length of time they ſtay there. And then the <hi>Lochia</hi> do almoſt reſemble, in colour and conſiſtence, troubled Milk, which makes the World believe it is Breaſt Milk which is in that manner emptied downwards; but in truth it is an Abuſe as great as common.</p>
               <p>For my part I know no other cauſe of this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary change of the colour and conſiſtence of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> nor of the diminution of their quantity, than that which we daily find in the Suppuration of a great wound ſomewhat incarnated: for aſſoon as the wound is firſt made, it bleeds, freſh, and in good large quantity, becauſe the Veſſels are then open; but a little after, during the firſt and ſecond daies, it yields only bloody Seroſities; foraſmuch as ſome ſmall portions of the Blood being clodded about the mouths of the Veſſels do in part ſtop them, and afterwards ſtopping them more, it yeilds a white<note n="*" place="margin">Mater.</note> 
                  <hi>Pus,</hi> which proceeding from the moiſture, ſweats through the ſubſtance of the fleſh, and of theſe Veſſels which have been but newly cloſed, acquires a thick and whitiſh conſiſtence by the heat of the part, and the ſtay it makes there. Now the better to conceive this by a compariſon, you muſt imagine that there is a kind of a wound made by the looſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Burthen from the Womb, by reaſon of which there happens, if it may be ſo ſaid, a kind of Suppuration, the <hi>Pus,</hi> and excretions of which are the <hi>Lochia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:171433:195"/>They which believe that when the <hi>Lochia</hi> ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> pale, it is the Milk of the Breaſts which flowes by the Womb, judge ſo, becauſe the Milk uſually abates in proportion to this evacuation, and ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that by the Colour and Conſiſtency it muſt needs be Milk: but if they were acquainted with Anatomy, they would know that there was no paſſage which hath to this purpoſe a communication from the Breaſts to the Womb, unleſs they think it is done by the means of this imaginary<note n="*" place="margin">The communication of Veins without Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, whereby they help one another.</note> 
                  <hi>Anaſtomoſis</hi> of the<note n="†" place="margin">Belonging to the Breaſts.</note> 
                  <hi>Mamillary</hi> Veins with the<note n="*" place="margin">Belonging to the Flanks.</note> 
                  <hi>Epigaſtrick;</hi> which cannot poſſibly be, becauſe neither of them have any tendency either to the Breaſts or the Womb, as Anatomy makes manifeſt; for the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millar</hi> comes from the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavicular</hi> under the <hi>Sternum</hi> without yielding any <hi>ſign</hi> to the Breaſts, nor ſo much as touching them, and the <hi>Epigaſtrick</hi> ariſeth from the <hi>Iliacks,</hi> without having the leaſt communication with the Womb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laurentius,</hi> who knew very well it was for this reaſon impoſſible Milk ſhould paſs from the Breaſts to the Womb by this paſſage, finds out another way, which is as far from the truth as the firſt. His opinion (as he ſaith) is that the Milk and Blood flow back from the Veins of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> which bedew the Breaſt to the <hi>Axillary</hi> Veins, and from thence to the Trunk of the <hi>Vena-cava,</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of which they flow down into the <hi>Hypoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrick</hi> Branch, and from thence finally into the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:171433:196"/>
Womb: but beſides, that it would be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for the Milk, after ſo long a way to come forth, without being perfectly mixed with Blood; the Circulation of the Blood, which he knew not, ſhewes us plainly that it is impoſſible, becauſe it doth mount back by the lower parts of the Body from the <hi>Vena cava</hi> to the Heart, without a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of carrying any thing into the Womb; whence it appears that he is as far as others from informing us how it can be done.</p>
               <p>For my part I believe with much more reaſon, and I think that it is not Breaſt milk which is thus evacuated by the <hi>Lochia,</hi> but this abundance and ſuperfluous humidity which diſtills from and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſudes the Veſſels and ſubſtance of the Womb, as I have explained, by means of which the whole ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of body being much emptied, there remains not ſufficient to be carried to the Breaſts, and little or none flowing to them; that which is contained in them is diſſipated by tranſpiration, and digeſted by the natural heat of the parts: Now the Milk by this evacuation is dried up, juſt as we ſee a Pond is that one would drain, out of which it is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to let the water run which fills it, but it ſufficeth to turn back the ſtream that feeds it to another place, which being done, and no more new water falling into the Pond, it will ſoon be dried up; as well becauſe the water is diſſipated in Vapours, as drunk in by the Earth which contains it. And for the ſame reaſon when we ſee Milch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurſes want their ordinary courſes, it is becauſe that all the redundant humours in their body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent to the Breaſts, and emptied by the ſucking of the Infant, there remains no ſuperfluities for
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:171433:196"/>
matter for the Terms: and for this cauſe it is not neceſſary that the Menſtrual blood ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from the Womb to the Breaſt, for Nurſes Milk to be made of it, but it is enough that the humours flow towards them, without going at all to the Womb; ſo likewiſe it is not neceſſary the Breaſt Milk ſhould be ſent to the Womb, to be evacuated with the <hi>Lochia,</hi> it being ſufficient that the humours are drawn towards it without going to the Breaſts.</p>
               <p>We muſt not think, as ſome imagine, that the Blood flowing after Labour is bad and corrupted, and the reliques of that good which the Infant hath taken for his Nouriſhment, nor that it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in and about thoſe places during the whole time of being with Child; for this Blood coming immediatly out of the Veſſels, opened by the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Burthen from the Womb, is the very ſame with all the reſt of the body, in which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after Labour no great change is obſerved, unleſs it be by ſo much alteration as the diſpoſition of the place from whence it proceeds may cauſe, and according as it flowes abundantly or ſlowly, and as it is mixt with other impurities which are emptied at that time, or that it makes ſome ſtay in the Womb after it is out of the Veſſels: and if it had ſo ſtaid in and about the Womb, as ſome would have it, without Circulation during the whole time of Pregnancy, 'tis moſt certain it would have putrified; even as we ſee the water of a Lake, for want of Agitation and Motion is infected and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; but there is no other ſuperfluity nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of the Childs nouriſhment, but the groſs blood with which the whole maſs of the <hi>Secondine</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed.
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:171433:197"/>
After having conſidered the nature and quality of theſe evacuations, we ſay that for their quantity and time of continuance there is no certain and particular Rule; for ſome Women have many a long time, and others but few and of a ſhort continuance, which uſually happens accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Seaſon, Country and Age, according to the Temperament more or leſs Hot, or Moiſt, the Habit more or leſs replete, and according to the Veſſels remaining a long or a ſhort time open. But in general this Evacuation is for the moſt part finiſhed in fifteen or twenty days, and ſooner or later according to the circumſtances lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and indifferently the ſame to a Woman delivered of a Boy or a Girl; during which time the <hi>Lochia</hi> diminiſh in quantity from day to day, until they totally ceaſe at the end of the ſame; afterwards the parts remain yet ſomewhat moiſt, without any manifeſt evacuation, except in Women ſubject to the <hi>Whites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This diſcourſe muſt be underſtood of Labours at full time; for after a Miſchance, the leſs the <hi>Foetus</hi> is, and the leſs time the Woman is gone with Child, the leſs ordinarily are her Evacuations.</p>
               <p>The Signs when the <hi>Lochia</hi> are good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, are, that they be freſh the three or four firſt days, and that they loſe this bloody tincture by degrees, and become pale, that they be of an equal conſiſtence without any curdled or clotted Blood, that they have no ill Scent, that they be without Acrimony, and that they flow in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate quantity.</p>
               <p>We ſay that they muſt not be freſh but the four firſt days, becauſe they will not be elſe the true

               <p>THere is ſo great a flux of Humours from all parts to the Womb, when a Woman is with Child, and during the commotion in her Labour, that in caſe there be not afterwards ſufficient evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, the Woman is in great danger of very ill Accidents, and ſometimes of death it ſelf; becauſe theſe humours, corrupting by their ſtay there, will certainly cauſe a great inflammation; and this is the reaſon why the ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Lochia</hi> is one of the worſt and moſt dangerous Symptoms which can befall a Woman after Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, eſpecially if they happen to be totally and ſuddenly ſtopt, the firſt three or four days, which is the time when they ſhould come down plentifully; for then follows an acute Fever, great pains in the Head, pains in the Breaſt, Reins, and Loins, ſuffocation of the Mother, and an Inflammation which is ſuddenly communicated all over the lower Belly, which becomes very much ſwelled and blown up; there happens alſo a great difficulty of Breathing, Choakings, Palpitations of the Heart, Syncopes and Faintneſs, Convulſions, and often Death if the ſuppreſſion continue; or if the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man eſcapes it, ſhe is in danger of an Abſceſs in
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:171433:198"/>
the Womb; yea, and afterwards a Cancer: or there may happen great Impoſthumes in the lower Belly, which is uſual, becauſe of the nearneſs of the place; as alſo Gouts, Sciaticas and Lameneſs, or Inflammation or Abſceſs in the Breaſt, if the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours be carried towards thoſe parts.</p>

                  </gap>uſes of the ſtoppage of the <hi>Lochia</hi> proceed either from a great Loofneſs, becauſe a great Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that way, turns the <hi>Lochia,</hi> and makes them ſtop; or any ſtrong Paſſions of the Mind, as great Fear, or Grief, or any Anger, or Soundings, for theſe things do cauſe the humours to retire ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inwards, and by this quick motion they often cauſe Suffocations. Great Cold ſtops the <hi>Lochia,</hi> becauſe it cloſes the Veſſels and Pores of the Womb: the uſe of aſtringent Remedies produces the ſame effect, as alſo cold Drink; becauſe by condenſing and thickning the humours, they hinder their eaſie flowing; ſtrong and frequent agitations of the Body, by rarifying and diſperſing them throughout every part, doth likewiſe not permit them to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated by the Womb.</p>
               <p>To bring the <hi>Lochia</hi> well down, let the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man avoid all perturbations of ſpirit which may ſtop them; let her lye in Bed with her Head and Breaſt a little raiſed, keeping her ſelf very quiet, that ſo the Humours may be the eaſier carried down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by their natural tendency; let her obſerve a a good Diet, ſomewhat hot and moiſt; let her rather uſe boiled Meats than roaſt: and if ſhe be any thing feaveriſh, let her uſe Broaths only with a little Jelly; let her avoid all binding things; let her <hi>Ptyſan</hi> be made with Aperitives, ſuch as are the Roots of <hi>Succory, Dogs-graſs</hi> and <hi>Aſparagus</hi> with a
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:171433:199"/>
little <hi>Aniſeed</hi> and <hi>Hops,</hi> and every other time let her take a little Syrup of <hi>Maiden-hair</hi> in a glaſs of this <hi>Ptyſan;</hi> and above all let her carefully ſhun cold Drink: Clyſters may likewiſe be given her to draw the Humours downwards; and her lower parts may be fomented with an <hi>emollient</hi> and <hi>aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Decoction made with <hi>Mallows, Marſhmallows, Pellitory</hi> of the wall, <hi>Camomil, Melilot,</hi> the roots of <hi>Aſparagus</hi> and <hi>Linſeed;</hi> with which Decoction the Womb may likewiſe be injected, and with the Herbs, being well boiled and ſtrained through a very courſe Cloth, let a <hi>Cataplaſme</hi> be made with the addition of Oyl of <hi>Lillies,</hi> or Hogſ-greaſe, and applyed very hot to the lower Belly: together with theſe let her Thighs and Legs be ſtrongly rub'd downwards, bathing them very hot with the ſame <hi>Emollient</hi> Decoction; there may be likewiſe apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed large Cupping-glaſſes to the uppermoſt part of the inſide of her Thighs. It would not be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to uſe an Aromatick Perfume, if it were not that it cauſed a heavineſs of the Head, as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> notes in the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now whilſt all theſe things are put in practice, bleeding in the Foot or Arm muſt not be forgot, according as the accidents cauſed by this ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Lochia</hi> require: neither muſt we blindly follow the opinion of many Women, who believe that bleeding in the Arm in this caſe is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious.</p>
               <p>This Imagination is ſo firmly rooted in the heads of almoſt all of them, that if in caſe a Child-bed
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:171433:199"/>
Woman happens to dye after bleeding in the Arm, they ſail not abſolutely to condemn that as the cauſe: But this their opinion is not according to knowledg, for ſometimes Bleeding in the Arm is better than in the Foot; and at other times that in the Foot is more certain than bleeding in the Arm: As for example, ſuppoſe a Woman be very full of Humours throughout the whole habit of her Body, and her <hi>Lochia</hi> be ſuppreſt, by reaſon of which there happens an Inflammation in her Womb, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a great Fever and difficulty of Breathing as it ordinarily arrives in theſe Caſes.</p>
               <p>'Tis moſt certain that if ſhe were immediatly blooded in the Foot, being very Plethorick as we have ſuppoſed, there would be ſo great abundance of Humours drawn down into the Womb, that the Inflammation would be thereby much augmented, and conſequently all the Accidents of the Diſtemper; but 't would be much better in this caſe rather to alter the Habit, firſt by bleeding in the Arm, and afterwards the moſt preſſing Accident being partly diminiſhed, it will be very much to the purpoſe to bleed in the Foot: for by this means Nature (which was almoſt overcome under the burthen of theſe redundant humours) being eaſed of ſome part of them, doth the more eaſily command and govern the reſt: but on the other ſide, if there be a ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page without the appearance of a great plenitude in the Body, and without any notable accident, Bleeding in the Foot, if it be deſired, may be then preſently put in practice. However I think it moſt convenient that it ſhould<note n="*" place="bottom">Not nceſſary, except for reaſons abovementioned.</note> alwaies be preceded with bleeding in one of the Arms.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Inflammation which happens to the Womb after Delivery.</head>
               <p>VEry often the ſtopping of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> (of which we have lately diſcourſed, and eſpecially at the beginning of Child-bed) doth cauſe an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the Womb, which is a very dangerous Diſeaſe, and the death of moſt of the Women to whom it happens.</p>
               <p>It is alſo very often cauſed from ſome hurt or bruiſe of the Womb by any Blow or Fall, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for having been too rudely handled in a bad and violent Labour; or by the falling out of the Womb after Labour; or elſe becauſe of ſome falſe Conception, or other ſtrange Body remaining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in it, which corrupts there; and likewiſe becauſe it might have been too much compreſſed in the beginning of the Labour by the great Swathes and Napkins wherewith the Midwives and Nurſ-keepers uſually ſwathe the Belly of a new-laid Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to keep it (as they ſay) in its place: which happens alſo very often when the Blood being ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and over-heated by the agitation of a rude Travail, is carried thither in too great abundance, and there ſtays without evacuation.</p>
               <p>An Inflammation of the Womb may be known by being much more ſwelled after Labour than is requiſite, and when the Woman feels very great heavineſs in the bottom of her Belly, and that it
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:171433:200"/>
is ſwelled, and blown up almoſt as big as before De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery; if ſhe have a difficulty in making Water and going to Stool; or that ſhe perceives her pain aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when ſhe is voiding her Excrements, becauſe the Womb preſſes the right Gut upon which it is placed, and to which by its proximity it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates the Inflammation, as well as to the Bladder; ſhe hath then alſo, beſides a great Fever with a very great difficulty of Breathing, a Hiccough, Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Convulſions, and in the end Death, if the Diſeaſe be not ſoon cured. A Woman that hath received a bruiſe or any violent compreſſion of the Womb, is in great danger, that after the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if ſhe do no die of it, an Abſceſs will be there made, or that there will remain ſome <hi>Scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhous</hi> Tumour, and it may be an incurable Cancer, which will make her lead a miſerable and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing life the reſt of her daies.</p>
               <p>Wherefore aſſoon as an Inflammation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the Cure of it muſt be endeavoured, by tempering the heat of the humours, and turning and emptying the ſuperfluities of them aſſoon as may be, firſt extracting or procuring the expulſion of ſuch ſtrange things as may remain in the Womb after Labour, according to the directions given in its proper place, and above all treating her at this time with very great tenderneſs, uſing not the leaſt violence, for fear the evil may be thereby augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>The Humours may be tempered by a cooling Diet, uſing food that nouriſhes little, wherefore let her be contented with only Broath for her nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made of Veal or Pullet, but not too ſtrong of the Fleſh, together with cooling Herbs, ſuch as
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:171433:201"/>
Lettice, Purſlane, Succory, Borrage, Sorrel and the like; let her abſtain from Wine, and drink <hi>Ptyſan</hi> made of the roots of <hi>Succory</hi> and <hi>Dogs-graſs, Barley,</hi> and <hi>Liquoriſh;</hi> let her keep her ſelf very quiet in her bed; let her not be ſwathed too ſtrait, and let her body be kept open with ſimple <hi>Anodine</hi> Clyſters; becauſe if there be any Acrimony in the humours they will cauſe Throwes, which extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pains the inflamed Womb; and amongſt all the paſſions of her mind let her eſpecially avoid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>The redundancy of Humours may be evacuated and diverted by Bleeding, which at firſt muſt be in the Arm, and not in the Foot, for the reaſons given in the foregoing Chapter, reiterating it without loſs of much time, for the accident is very preſſing, until that the greateſt part of the plenitude be a little evacuated, and the Inflammation ſomething diminiſhed, and then bleeding in the Foot will not be amiſs, if the caſe require it.</p>
               <p>It may be convenient to anoint the Belly with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum refrigerans Galeni,</hi> or Oyl of Roſes, or Oyl of ſweet Almonds mixt with a little Vinegar. Injections may likewiſe be given into the Womb, provided they be not Reſtringent, leſt making a greater ſtoppage of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> which alwaies flow a little in this caſe, the diſtemper be not augmented; for which reaſon let temperate Medicines be only uſed, without any manner of aſtriction, as Barley water with Oyle of Violets, or luke-warm Milk.</p>
               <p>Sometimes an Inflammation of the Womb con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts into an Apoſthume, which yeilds a great quantity of matter; there is then much danger of corruption in that part, as well by reaſon of its
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:171433:201"/>
Heat and Moiſture, which are the principals of it' as becauſe no proper Remedies can be applied, or eaſily kept to it; ſince therefore nothing elſe can be done, we muſt be contented with an univerſal <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen</hi> and <hi>Deterſive</hi> Injections to cleanſe off the matter, that ſo the corruption be not augmented by its long ſtay there, which may be effected by a Decoction of <hi>Barley</hi> and <hi>Agrimony</hi> mixt with Oyle of Roſes and Syrup of Wormwood, and heightned with ſome Spirit of Wine, if there be a great putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. But if the Impoſthume turnes to an ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Cancer, then, notwithſtanding the uſe of any Remedies whatſoever, this miſcheivous diſeaſe will endure 'till death; wherefore we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with <hi>Palliative</hi> Medicines, a good Diet: and in this follow the precept of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> of his <hi>Eighth</hi> Book; <hi>Quibus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culti Cancri fiunt, non curare melius: curati enim citius intereunt, non curati vero longius vitam tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hunt.</hi> 
                  <q>It is better, ſaies he, not to take an occult and hidden Cancer in hand, for it haſtens the death of the Patient, and they which let it alone live longeſt.</q> Now he means by an occult Cancer, that which breeds within the Body, and eſpecially that in the Womb.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the Inflammation of the Breaſts of the new-laid Woman.</head>
               <p>UNtil of late it was alwaies believed that the Blood was the matter whereof the Milk was made in the Breaſts; but it is much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the <hi>Chyle</hi> onely, and not the Blood, is deſtined to its generation, as well as it is the true matter out of which all the Blood of the Body is made. That which eaſily makes us judg ſo, is the new diſcovery of the Channel of the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,</hi> which conveighs the <hi>Chyle</hi> into the <hi>Subclavian</hi> Vein, found out by Monſieur <hi>Pecquet</hi> Phyſician of the Faculty of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> to whom all poſterity will be eternally indebted, for having means here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of being diſabuſed of ſeveral notable Errors, which for want of ſo fair and neceſſary a knowledg was ſlid and entertained into the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick until this time. However ſince the Veſſels which may for this purpoſe conveigh part of this <hi>Chyle</hi> to the Breaſts are not yet manifeſtly known, we will content our ſelves to explain after the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner the cauſe of the Inflammation of the Breaſts, which doth very often happen to Women newly delivered.</p>
               <p>All the Blood and Humours are ſo heated and agitated during Travail, by the Pains and Throws of Labour, that the Breaſts compoſed of glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſpongious bodies, eaſily receiving in too
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:171433:202"/>
great abundance of theſe Humours, which flow to them from all parts, are ſoon inflamed thereby; becauſe this Repletion doth very ſenſibly and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtend them: to this contributes very much the ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> and an univerſal ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Body. This Inflamation may likewiſe happen by the Womans having been too ſtrait laced; by ſome blow received upon the Breaſts; or for having lain upon them, which eaſily bruiſe them, as alſo for want of having given Milk to the Child: in as much as by this means the Milk, which is in great quantity in the Breaſts, not being evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is overheated, &amp; corrupts by too-long ſtay there. But from whatſoever cauſe this Inflamation of the Breaſts in a Woman new-laid may proceed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Remedies muſt be ſpeedily applyed, leſt it afterwards apoſthumates; or elſe that not ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, there remains a <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> hardneſs, which in time may degenerate into a Cancer, a very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Malady, and for the moſt part incurable when confirmed. Beſides the danger that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation of the Breaſts may be converted into theſe dangerous diſtempers, there happens uſually to the Woman in thoſe parts, which are very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, an extream pain, which often cauſeth ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fits, and afterwards a Fever, with ſo great a burning of the whole Body, that ſhe can ſcarce en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any Cloaths upon her; and when ſhe doth never ſo little uncover her ſelf, or put her Arms out of the Bed, ſhe hath new ſhaking fits, which afterwards augment the heat of her Feaver: it is no great wonder that a Feaver ſoon happens upon this occaſion, becauſe the Breaſts by their nearneſs, to the Heart do eaſily communicate their Inflama<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:171433:203"/>
which ſometimes excite Fury and Phrenzy, if the Blood be ſuddenly and in great abundance carried thither; as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> aſſures us in the 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> of his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book; <hi>Quibuſcunque Mulieribus ad Mammas ſanguis colligitur, furorem ſignificat.</hi> 
                  <q>If (ſaies he) the blood be carried to, and in great abundance collected in the Breaſts, it ſignifies that Fury and Phrenzy will follow.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now the principal and moſt certain means to hinder the afflux of ſo great a quantity of Humours to the Breaſts, and prevent the coming of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation there, is to procure a good and ample evacuation of the <hi>Locbia</hi> by the Womb. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they are ſuppreſt, they muſt be provoked by the means elſwhere directed, for by this evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation all the Humours will take their courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the lower parts. The whole habit of Body may be emptied by bleeding in the Arm; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for a greater diverſion, and the better to bring down the <hi>Lochia,</hi> bleed in the Foot; during which, <hi>Topical</hi> Remedies to the Breaſt muſt not be forgot, as in the beginning, to chaſe well into them Oile of Roſes and Vinegar beat together, laying upon them afterwards <hi>Unguentum refrigerans Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leni,</hi> and a third part of <hi>Populion</hi> mixt with it; or a <hi>Cataplaſme</hi> made of the ſetlings found in a Cutlers Grin-ſtone-Trough, Oile of Roſes and a little Vinegar mixt together: if the pain continue very great, another <hi>Cataplaſm</hi> may be made of the Crum of white Bread, and Milk mixt with Oile of Roſes, and the Yolks of raw Eggs, upon all theſe may be laid Compreſſes dipt in Vinegar and Water, or in <hi>Plantane</hi> Water; but great care muſt be taken that theſe Remedies applied to the Breaſt be only
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:171433:203"/>
cooling and repreſſing, without any great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, for it may cauſe a <hi>ſcirrhous</hi> tumor, which would remain a long time, and it may be a worſe diſtemper.</p>
               <p>After the height of the Inflammation ſhall be paſt, and the greateſt part of the antecedent Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours evacuated and turned aſide, let Medicines a little reſolving be uſed, to digeſt, reſolve and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Milk which abounds in the Breaſts, to prevent corruption by its ſtay; wherefore let them be drawn by the Child, or ſome other perſon, or elſe reſolved, unleſs that it be ſuppurated: It may be reſolved by the application of pure Honey to the Breaſts, which in this caſe is very effectual, or elſe a red <hi>Cabbadg</hi>-leaf may be anointed with it, and applyed to the Breaſts, having firſt withered it a little before the Fire, and all the hard Stalks and Veins taken out: do not lace the Breaſts too ſtrait, nor apply any courſe or rough Clothes to them, that they may not be therewith ſcratched and bruiſed. A very good remedy for the ſame is, a whole red Cabbage boiled in River water to a Pap, and then well bruiſed in a wooden or marble Mortar, and pulp'd through a Sieve, which mixt with Oyle of <hi>Camomil</hi> may be applied as a <hi>Poultis</hi> to the Breaſts,</p>
               <p>In the uſe of all theſe means, let the Woman ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a cooling Diet, not very nouriſhing, that too much Blood and Humours may not be engendered, of which there is already too great a quantity; ſhe muſt alwaies keep her Body open, that the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours may be ſo much the more carried down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and conſequently turned from the Breaſts. During the whole time the Inflammation continues,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:171433:204"/>
let her keep her Bed, lying on her back, that ſhe may have the more eaſe; for being raiſed, the Breaſts which are groſs and heavy, becauſe of the abundance of humours, with which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, do very much pain her when they hang down; let her ſtir her Arms as little as may be; and after the fourteenth or fifteenth day of her Child-bed, when ſhe hath ſufficiently cleanſed, and the Inflammation is abated, and ſhe no longer Feveriſh, purge her once or twice, as the caſe ſhall require, to empty the ill humours which remain in the whole habit of her Body. If, notwithſtanding all theſe Remedies, the ſwelling of the Breaſt doth not go down, and that ſhe ſtill feels much pain, and a great Pulſation, with a hardneſs more in one place than another, is is certain it will apoſthumate there, of which we will treat hereafter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Curdling and Clodding of the Milk.</head>
               <p>IN the beginning of Child-bed the Womans Milk is not well purified, becauſe of the great commotion her Body ſuffered during Labour, and it is then mixt with many other Humours; now if they are then conveyed to the Breaſts in too great abundance, they cauſe an Inflammation treated in the foregoing Chapter; but when the Infant hath already ſucked fifteen or twenty days or more, the Milk then only without this mixture of humours is
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:171433:204"/>
contained there, and ſometimes curdles and clods. And then the Breaſts, which before were ſoft and even, become hard, uneven and rugged, without any redneſs; and the diſtinction and ſeparation of all the Kernels fill'd with curdled Milk, may eaſily be perceived. The Woman finds a great pain there, and cannot milk them as before; ſhe finds a ſhivering, eſpecially about the middle of her Back, which ſeems to her like Ice. This Shivering is uſually followed by a Fever of four and twenty Hours continuance; and ſometimes leſs, if the clodding of the Milk do not turn to an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Breaſts, which will undoubtedly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, if it be not emptyed, or diſſipated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
               <p>This Clodding of the Milk for the moſt part proceeds, becauſe the Breaſts are not fully drawn; either for that ſhe hath too much Milk, or the Infant is too ſmall and weak to ſuck all, or becauſe ſhe doth not deſire to be a Nurſe; for the Milk in theſe caſes remaining in the Breaſts, after concoction, without being drawn, loſeth the Sweetneſs and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity it had, and by means of the Heat that it there acquires, and the too long ſtay it there makes, ſowring, it curdles and clods; juſt as we ſee <hi>Rennet</hi> put into ordinary Milk, turneth it into Curds: this accident may likewiſe happen from having taken a great Cold, or keeping the Breaſts not well covered.</p>
               <p>From whatſoever cauſe this Curdling proceeds, the readieſt and moſt certain Remedy is, ſpeedily to draw the Breaſts, until they are emptied and dried; but becauſe the Infant being weak and ſmall cannot draw ſtrong enough, by reaſon the Woman
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:171433:205"/>
is not ſoft milcht: when the Milk is ſo curdled, let another Woman draw them, until the Milk comes freely, and then ſhe may give the Child ſuck: and to the end ſhe may not afterwards breed more Milk than the Child can draw, let her uſe Diet that gives but little nouriſhment, and keep her body alwaies open. But when it happens that the Woman neither can nor will be a Nurſe, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to uſe other means for the curing of this diſtemper: Then her Breaſts muſt not be drawn; for attracting more humours, the diſeaſe will ever recur if they be not again emptied. Wherefore 'tis neceſſary to prevent the coming of any more Milk into them, and to reſolve and diſſipate that which is there: for this purpoſe the plenitude of the Body muſt be emptied by bleeding in the Arm; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this evacuation, let the Humours be drawn down by ſtrong Clyſters, and bleeding in the Foot, purging alſo if it be neceſſary; and to reſolve, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and diſſipate the curdled Milk, apply the <hi>Gata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſme</hi> which we ſaid was proper, as that of pure Honey; or that of the four Brans boiled in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of <hi>Sage, Milk, Smallage</hi> and <hi>Fennel,</hi> mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it Oile of <hi>Camomil,</hi> with which Oile the Breaſts may likewiſe be well anointed.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes ſeen Women apply to their Breaſts, with no ſmall ſucceſs, the Linnen-covers of Salt-butter-pots; it is a drying Remedy, and lie to ſoak up the moiſture of theſe parts, and may be uſed; provided the Remedies before mentioned have diſcuſs'd the Milk: but it notwithſtanding all this it cannot be diſſipated nor reſolved, there is great danger by its long ſtay there, that it will cauſe an Inflammation of the Breaſts:</p>

               <p>THere may at all times happen to Maids as well as Wives Apoſthumes of the Breaſts, either hot or cold, the cure of which doth not differ, as ſaith <hi>Guido;</hi> except that too ſtrong Repercuſſives muſt not be uſed, becauſe of their nearneſs to the Heart, and that the retention of the Courſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes much to the breeding of them, and their provocation to their Cure, as alſo bleeding in the <hi>Saphaena:</hi> but our intention is only to treat of thoſe which happen to a new-laid Woman, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſucceeds an Infiammation of the Breaſts, cauſed by corruption of the Milk, and too great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Blood and Humours conveighed thither.</p>
               <p>After all poſſible endeavours have been uſed to cauſe this Inflammation to ceaſe, whether by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal evacuation of the Body, as well by bleeding in the Arm and Foot, as the provocation of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> or alſo by Medicines reſtraining, repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or ſimply-diſſolving applyed to the Breaſts; if the Woman ſtill ſuffers great pain there, and hath
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:171433:206"/>
aſtrong Pulſation more in one place than another, where a hardneſs of a livid colour may alſo be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and ſoft in the middle, 'tis a ſign that they will apoſthumate. Then the application of all the former Topicks muſt be forborn, and ripening Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines applyed; it being much better to make a perfect Suppuration, than longer to uſe Repellers or Reſolvers, leſt the matter be more confirmed, in driving back and only reſolving the more ſubtile parts, leaving the thicker behind in the Breaſts, which will become <hi>ſcirrhous,</hi> and be very difficult to diſſipate, or by its long continuance, as it often happens, may turn to a Cancer.</p>
               <p>To ſuppurate the Apoſthume, put an emollient and ripening Poultis upon the Breaſts, ſuch as that made of <hi>Mallows</hi> and <hi>Marſh-mallows</hi> with their Roots, <hi>Lilly</hi>-roots, and <hi>Linſeed</hi> bruiſed, boiled to a Pap, that it may be pulp'd through a Sieve, that ſo no hardneſs may be left to hurt the Breaſts, which are then in great pain; afterwards mix a good quantity of Hogſ-greaſe or <hi>Baſilicon</hi> with it, and lay a little Cloath, thick ſpread with the ſame <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon</hi> upon the place where it is likely ſooneſt to break, and the Poultis all over it, nenewing it twelve hours after, or at furtheſt next day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing this Remedy 'till the Apoſthume be fully ripe. It is much better to uſe this Cataplaſme, or the like, than Plaiſters; for a Poultis cloſeth better by its ſoftneſs, and is more equally applyed to the Breaſts; it mollifies it alſo, and keeps it much more ſupple; beſides it is eaſier changed and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed than Plaiſters, which by their ſticking do very much incommode theſe parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:171433:206"/>Aſſoon as the Apoſthume is ripe, it muſt be opened, if it open not of it ſelf. The time when it is fit, may be known, by the ceaſing of the beating the Woman felt before in her Breaſts, and that the pain and Fever is much diminiſhed; and then beſides, the middle of the Apoſthume is a little elevated to a point and very ſoft, and the contained matter may by the Finger be perceived to fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate.</p>
               <p>When theſe ſigns ſhall appear, the Apoſthume muſt be opened in the fitteſt place, to give iſſue to this matter; being careful not to do it too ſoon, and before the matter is fully ripe, becauſe of too much pain: for the Breaſts are very ſenſible parts, and eaſily receive a Defluxion, becauſe of their thin and ſpongious ſubſtance, interlaced with an infinite number of Veſſels. Wherefore it muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ripen, yet not ſuffered to ſtagnate there too long. This apertion may be made with a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, or with a grain of potential <hi>Cantery,</hi> making it large enough to evacuate ſuch Clods, as are there uſually met with: but it is beſt to uſe the Lancet, becauſe there is no loſs of ſubſtance, and the Scar is not ſo deformed, as that which ſucceeds the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a <hi>Cautery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guido</hi> would have this Inciſion made in the form of an Half-moon, to follow the round Figure of the Breaſt; but it is no matter of what faſhion it is, provided it be in a place convenient for the empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter, and that care be taken that ſome great Veſſels be not opened, the principal of which are towards the Arm-pits. After that all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and putrified clodded Milk there found be emptied, the Apoſthume after the uſual manner
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:171433:207"/>
muſt be cleanſed and mundified, obſerving not to make the Tents too long nor too hard, but only very ſoft pledgits of Lint, without thruſting them too deep in, faſtening a Thread to the firſt, if there be occaſion, the better to draw it out, becauſe theſe Apoſthumes ordinarily are hollow. If there be much pain dip the Boulſters in Oile of Eggs, or <hi>Baſilicon</hi> mixt with a Digeſtive, if there remain any thing yet to Suppurate; afterwards uſe Deterſives and Mundifiers, as Honey of Roſes, or <hi>Unguentum Apoſtolorum,</hi> according as the caſe requires, laying upon it a good Plaiſter <hi>de Mucilaginibus,</hi> to ſoften that hardneſs which may yet remain.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of Excoriation, and loſs of the Nipples.</head>
               <p>VEry often Women that are Nurſes, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the firſt time, are ſubject to have their Nipples, which are endued with an exquiſite ſence, (becauſe that many ſmall nervous Filaments do there terminate) chopped and excoriated; which is very painful to them, and inſupportable, when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this indiſpoſition they give ſuck to their Children, and ſo much the more, by how much they are hard milch't, as it happens the firſt time, the Milk not yet having made way through the ſmall Holes of the Nipples, which are not yet throughly opened, and then the Child takes more pains to ſuck, than when the Breaſts do almoſt run of themſelves; and ſometimes theſe Chops and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coriations do ſo encreaſe by the Childs continual ſucking, that in the end it takes the Nipple quite off from the Breaſts, and the Woman is no longer capable of giving ſuck, and there remains ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an Ulcer very hard to be cured.</p>
               <p>This may ſometimes happen from Childrens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo dry and hungry, that they have not patience
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:171433:209"/>
to ſuck ſoftly, and finding the Milk not ſpeedily to follow as they deſire, they do bite and mump the Nipple ſo ſtrongly (thinking to draw Milk down the better,) whether they have Teeth or no, that they become raw, and in <hi>fine</hi> ſtill continuing it, they are quite taken away, as we have ſaid. It happens alſo that other Infants have their Mouths ſo hot, that they make the Nipples ſore, as when the Children have thoſe little Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, called<note n="*" place="margin">Thruſh.</note> 
                  <hi>Apthae,</hi> and much ſooner if they have the Pox, with which alſo they may infect the Nurſes, and then thoſe Ulcers ſo cauſed do not eaſily yield to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Remedies, but on the contrary grow daily worſe and worſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe Chops and Excoriations muſt not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, as well by reaſon of the great pain they put the Woman to, when ſhe gives ſuck, as to avoid their dayly growing worſe and worſe; and at length their turning to malignant Ulcers: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſoon as they begin, let the Woman forbear giving her Child ſuck, until they are quire cured; for with continual ſucking it will be very difficult to hinder its return by irritating of them, during which the Milk muſt for a ſmall time be kept back; leſt by being no longer drawn, it cauſe an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Breaſt through its great abundance. However if but one Nipple be ſore, ſhe may give ſuck with the other: to theſe ſore Nipples <hi>Deſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Medicines may be applyed, as Allum, or Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water; or they may be only bathed with <hi>Plantain</hi> water, putting upon them ſmall ſoft Rags dipped in any of them; or uſe a ſmall <hi>Ceruſe</hi> Plaiſter, or ſome Ointment, as <hi>Dia Pompholygos,</hi> or a little powder
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:171433:209"/>
                  <hi>Amylon;</hi> but eſpecially care muſt be taken, that nothing be applyed to diſguſt the Child, wherefore many content themſelves to uſe only honey of Roſes.</p>
               <p>Some will inſtead of <hi>Deſiccatives</hi> uſe <hi>Emolients,</hi> but there muſt be a diſtinction, for <hi>Emollients</hi> are fit to preſerve from ſuch <hi>Fiſſures;</hi> but when they are already made, <hi>Deſiccatives</hi> are beſt: and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Woman from hurts in theſe parts, which are very painful, and that the Rags may not ſtick to them, one ought to put upon them a little Wax, or Wooden Caps, or Leaden ones, they being more <hi>Deſiccative,</hi> like to thoſe repreſented in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of the Chapter, which muſt have ſeveral ſmall holes on the tops of them, as well to give iſſue to the <hi>Sanies,</hi> which proceeds from the ſmall Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as that the Milk, which often diſtills out of the Nipples, may by this means paſs away.</p>
               <p>If the Child hath wholly ſuck'd off the Nipples, the Milk muſt then be quite dried away, that ſo the Ulcers which remain may be the ſooner healed, for elſe one ſhall hardly obtain their end, and in time they may become <hi>callous</hi> and malignant: and if the Child hath the Pox, it will be very difficult to heal thoſe Ulcers of the Nurſes Nipples, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to ſuck: wherefore the Child muſt be put to another, who muſt uſe Preſervatives againſt this Malady; but if they be only ſmall ſimple Ulcers in the Mouth, without any malignity, 'tis enough to waſh them with Barley-water, mixt with a little Juice of Citrons; and the better to temper theſe Humours, which are over-heated, let the Nurſe take a cooling Diet, that her Milk may become of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:171433:210"/>
the ſame temperament, and let her be blooded and purged, if it be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>When the Nipples are quite loſt, it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to give a Child longer ſuck; becauſe it can take no hold to ſuck the Milk, and alſo the ſmall holes of the Nipples are cloſed up by the Ulcers. But if notwithſtanding ſhe ſhall deſire to give ſuck, another Woman muſt by degrees make her new Nipples, after the Ulcer ſhall be perfectly healed, whoſe ſucking with her mouth will draw them out, and by this means unſtop the root of the old Nipples; or uſing a fit Inſtrument of glaſs, ſuch as is figured at the begining of this Chapter, with which the Woman her ſelf, may alſo ſuck them five or ſix times a day; and to ſhape them, and ſo preſerve them, being thus drawn out, from ſinking into the Breaſts again, let her put upon them a ſmall Cap of wood, or other matter, ſuch as is abovementioned, and doing ſo by degrees after the Nipples are quite form'd and unſtop'd, ſhe may again give her Child ſuck.</p>
               <p>What we have hitherto writ in this third Book, ſhall ſuffice for directions concerning a new-laid Woman, and alſo for the knowledg and cure of diſtempers which uſually happen to them, upon which we need not further enlarge, for if any other happen than what we have mentioned, and which do not properly belong to the care of a Chirurgeon, a Phyſitian muſt be ſent for, to remedie them by his prudence, and according as Art requires.

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of tending Children new-born, and firſt how to bind, cut, and ſwath the Navel-ſtring.</head>
               <p>IF the Infant (as we have ſaid before diſcourſing of Deliveries) hath often need whileſt he is in his Mothers belly, of the good conduct and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of a Chirurgeon, or Midwife, to deliver him and bring him happily forth out of that Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, wherein he hath been a long time incloſed, their aſſiſtance is nothing leſs neceſſary to him aſſoon as he is born, as well to remedy ſuch indiſpoſitions which ſometimes he brings into the world, as to defend him from many infirmities, to which the weakneſs of his Age and tenderneſs of his Body renders him ſubject. We have in the whole fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going-Book very particularly ſhown how to help him in his coming into the world, there remaines now only directions what is to be done afterwards, to this purpoſe we will firſt ſhew how to tye, cut and bind up the Navel-ſtring.</p>
               <p>There are ſome perſons who aſſoon as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is come into the World, do bind and cut the Navel-ſtring, before the burthen be come away; but it is better, if poſſible without too-long ſtay, to deſer it until the Secondine be likewiſe drawn forth; for the Womb, which is extreamly wide and open after the coming forth of the Child, would be in danger of taking cold by the outward aire, during the delay made for the Ligature of the Umbilical
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:171433:211"/>
Veſſel; beſides that the Orifice cloſeing a little, it would afterwards be more difficult to bring the After-birth away.</p>
               <p>To make this Ligature as it behooveth, let the Midwife do as followeth; aſſoon then as all is come away from the Woman, ſhe muſt immediately cloſe up the Womb with clouts, according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections already given, and then carry away the Child and Burthen to the fire; having put it into a warm Bed and Blancket, let her take a brown Thread four or five double, of a quarter of an Ell long or thereabouts, tyed with a ſingle knot at each of the ends, to prevent their entangling, and with this thread ſo accommodated (which the Midwife muſt have in a readineſs before Labour, as alſo a good pair of Sciſſers, that ſo no time may be loſt) let her tye the ſtring within an Inch of the Belly, with a double knot, and turning about the ends of the thread, let her tye two more on the other ſide of the ſtring, reiterating it again, if it be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for greater ſurety; then let her cut off the Navel-ſtring another Inch below the Ligature, towards the After-birth, ſo that there only remain but two inches of the ſtring, in the midſt of which will be the knot we ſpeak of, which muſt be ſo ſtrait knit, as not to ſuffer a drop of blood to ſqueez out of the Veſſels, but not ſo ſtrait as to cut it in two.</p>
               <p>For which reaſon the Thread muſt be pretty thick and pretty ſtrait knit, it being better too-ſtrait than too-looſe: for ſome Children have miſerably loſt their lives with all their blood before it was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; becauſe the Navel-ſtring was not well tyed. Now that ſo great a Miſchief may not happen, great care muſt be taken after it is cut, that no blood
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:171433:211"/>
ſqueez through; for if there do, new knots muſt be made with the reſt of the ſtring, (which for this reaſon muſt be left a little long) to cloſe it more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly; this being done, wrap up the end of the String thus cut and tyed three or four times about with a ſmall rag, drie, or dipt in Oile of Roſes, if you pleaſe; then having put another ſmall Rag three or four double upon the Belly of the Child above the Navil, lay the String ſo wrapp'd up upon it, that it may not touch the naked Belly; on the top of all put another ſmall Boulſter, and then ſwathe it with a linnen Swath four Fingers broad to keep it ſteady, leſt by rowling too much, or by being continually ſtirr'd from ſide to ſide, by the motion of the Belly, it comes to fall off, before the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels be quite cloſed up and healed.</p>
               <p>'Tis very convenient, as we have ſaid, to lay the remaining part of the String on the upper part of the Belly, that ſo, if by chance the Veſſels be not ſufficiently cloſed, the Blood may not ſo ſoon ſlide away, as if it were turned downwards; for we find ſometimes this String to be ſo great in ſome Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that although it were very cloſe tyed at firſt, yet coming afterwards to wither and dry, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature is rendred looſer, by means of which 'twill afterwards eaſily bleed, if care be not taken. This Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident hapned lately to a poor Child, who died the twelfth day by ſuch a flux of Blood, although the Midwife proteſted to me, that ſhe had tyed the String very exactly; and being aſtoniſhed how that could happen: ſhe told me, that it muſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly be, (which indeed was the truth) becauſe the Knot was looſened in proportion to the withering of the String; wherefore to avoid ſuch a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:171433:212"/>
let a new Knot be knit the firſt time the Child is opened.</p>
               <p>The String thus tyed begins daily to dry away, and is ſeparated from the Belly at the end of the ſixth or ſeventh day ordinarily, and ſometimes ſooner, but rarely longer than the eighth or ninth; it muſt alwaies fall off of it ſelf without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, leſt that being ſeparated too ſoon, and before the Veſſels ſhall be entirely cloſed and healed up, a flux of Blood follow, which is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as we have ſaid, or that it cauſe an Ulcer very hard to be cured.</p>
               <p>There are ſome good Goſſips, who are a little ſuperſtitious in the tying of this String longer or ſhorter, according to the difference of the Sex, for ſome pleaſant reaſons they give, but it is a meer abuſe; for at whatſoever diſtance they tye the Knot, either nearer or further, though half a foot from the Belly, yet it will alwaies be ſeparated in the very ſame place, juſt cloſe to the Belly, becauſe it is a part which remains wholly<note n="*" place="margin">Without life.</note> inanimate, after the Child is come into the World; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether Boies or Girles, let the Knot be made at leaſt an inch from the Belly, as we have already directed; and not nearer, leſt it pain or inflame the Childs Navel.</p>
               <p>It will not be from the purpoſe to mention here a buſineſs of great conſequence, which is ſometimes capable to kill the new-born Babe, without almoſt knowing the cauſe of it; 'tis a very bad cuſtome ſome Midwives have, before they make the Knot, they drive all the blood out of the String into the Infants Belly, believing that by this means they
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:171433:212"/>
fetch it to it ſelf, and ſtrengthen it when it is weak: but 'tis no ſuch matter, for aſſoon as theſe Veſſels are never ſo little cooled, the blood it contains quickly loſes its ſpirits, and is half coagulated in an inſtant, which is the reaſon, that being driven back into the Infants Liver, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cauſe very great Accidents; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its abundance, but becauſe having quite loſt its natural heat, it is afterwards ſoon corrupted, and changeth and ſpoileth the Childs Blood, with which it comes to mix. They commonly put this ill cuſtome in practice when the Child is weak; but this doth ſooner ſuffocate them, for if they need Blood to give them vigour, it muſt be good and laudable, and not that which is half clodded, and deſtitute of its natural heat. Wherefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Child be ſtrong or weak, if you will not put it in danger of its life, or at leaſt cauſe to him great oppreſſions, pains and gripes, forbear driving his blood thus out of the String into the Infants body. Now having thus tyed and cut the String, waſh the Child preſently all over, for to ſwaddle it afterwards, as we ſhall direct.</p>

it will not eaſily be waſh'd off of theſe places, it may be fetcht off with Oile of ſweet Almonds, or a little freſh Butter melted with the Wine, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards well dried off; one muſt alſo cleanſe and unſtop with tents of fine Rags, wet in this liquour, the Ears and Noſtrils; for the Eyes, they may be wiped with a ſoft dry rag, not dipt in this Wine, that it may not pain them and make them ſmart.</p>
               <p>After the Child is thus waſhed and cleanſed from theſe Impurities and Blood which comes away in the Labour, with which ſometimes its whole Body is beſmeared, all the parts of it muſt be viſited, to ſee if there be any fault or diſlocation, whether the Noſe be ſtraight, or its Tongue tyed, whether there be no bruiſe or tumor of the Head, or whether the Mould be not overſhotten, or whether the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> in caſe it be a Male, be not blown up and ſwelled; in ſhort, whether it ſuffered any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in any part of its Body, and whether they be well and duely ſhaped, that ſo Remedies may be uſed according to the nature of the indiſpoſition diſcovered. But as it is not ſufficient to cleanſe the outſide of the Childs body; you muſt above all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it muſt diſcharge the Excrements re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within: wherefore examine whether the Conduits of the Urine and Stool be opened, for ſome have been born without having them perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, who have died for want of voiding their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, becauſe timely care was not taken of it: as to the Urine, all Children as well Males as Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, do render it aſſoon as they are born, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they feel the heat of the fire, and ſometimes alſo the <hi>Maeconion</hi> of the Guts, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs uſually a little after. If the Infant doth
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:171433:214"/>
not render it the firſt day, that it may not remain too long in his Belly, and cauſe very painful Gripes, put up into his fundament a ſmall Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory, to ſtir it up to be diſcharged; to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a ſugar'd Almond may be uſed, anointed over with a little boiled Honey, or elſe a ſmall piece of <hi>Caſtile</hi>-ſoap, rubb'd over with freſh Butter; you may alſo give the Child to this purpoſe at the Mouth a little Syrup of Roſes, or Violets, mixt with ſome Oyl of Sweet Almonds drawn without fire, anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Belly alſo with the ſame Oyl or a little freſh Butter. It may be known when the Child hath voided all its <hi>Maeconion,</hi> if the Stools change from black and become pale, which is about the <hi>ſecond</hi> or <hi>third</hi> day, loſing by degrees this tincture in proportion to the generation of new Excrements from the Milk, which about this time mixes with the firſt.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Maeconion,</hi> which is an Excrement in colour and conſiſtence like to the Pulp of <hi>Caſſia,</hi> found in the Childs Guts when it comes into the World, 'twill be enough to the purpoſe to examine what it is, and from whence it proceeds; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without dwelling upon the different explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Authors touching its generation, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly give my thoughts of it; which is, that it comes from the ſuperfluous Blood daily diſcharged, as it doth in all perſons and of all ages, by means of the <hi>Hepatick</hi> channel, which coming from the hollow of the Liver, goeth and emptyeth into the Inteſtine <hi>Duodenum,</hi> out of which is formed the <hi>Moeconion,</hi> which afterwards ſerves to keep the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines of the <hi>Foelus</hi> open and dilated, that ſo they may the better perform their office after its birth;
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:171433:214"/>
and to make it appear that it is truely thus made, and that the ſuperfluous Blood is continually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by the <hi>Hepatick</hi> channel into the <hi>Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> as I do ſay, there are ſome people of Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years of age, that were never let Blood, nor never loſt any outwardly, who nevertheleſs do and have bred ſome every day, as muſt neceſſarily confeſt. Now if they did not void it this way, they muſt ſoon be ſuffocated by its too-great abundance. I know that many may anſwer me, that it is more credible that this diſcharge is made by the branches of the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> diſtributed throughout the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery:</hi> but ſuch as are acquainted with the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, know that naturally it cannot well be ſo, &amp; I believe they would ſoon be of my opinion, if they did but well conſider it; and it is not ſufficient to refute me, by objecting, that if the ſuperfluity of Blood be thus daily voided, one would alwaies have bloody Stooles; becauſe it is not unknown that this portion of ſuperfluous Blood, which is very ſmall in compariſon of the other Excrements proceeding from the Aliment with which it is mixt, doth eaſily there receive a change of colour, by the alteration and kind of concoction there made, whence it happens that it is not ſo eaſily perceived in a Man as a Child, in whom the <hi>Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conion</hi> being yet without any mixture, retaines more of the colour; as alſo becauſe 'tis engendered of Blood only, which hath been ſeparated as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to its nouriſhment, and is after this manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. Now foraſmuch as there is but little ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Blood in an Infants body, whileſt it is in the Womb, becauſe it conſumes a great deal of it for its nouriſhment and growth; beſides that it hath
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:171433:215"/>
been purified by the Mother, before it is conveyed to him; ſo likewiſe there is but little <hi>Moeconion</hi> ingendred during the whole time of Praegnancy; for which reaſon alſo the Infant doth not void any during its ſtay in the Womb; but it doth when it is born, for then it receives nouriſhment by the Mouth, of which plenty of other Excrements are made, which forceth him to caſt forth the firſt: and although the <hi>Moeconion</hi> hath continued in the Infants Guts, during the whole time it was in the Mother's Belly, nevertheleſs, which is very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, it hath nothing neer ſo ill a ſcent as the new Excrements have, which are engendred out of the nouriſhment taken in at the Mouth after it is born, although they make but a very ſmall ſtay there, and are daily diſcharged.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon then as the Midwife hath waſhed and cleanſed the Child according to directions, and that ſhe hath viewed every part of its Body, let her begin to ſwaddle it in its Swathing-Cloaths, begining firſt to cover the Head with a ſmall linnen Biggen,<note n="*" place="margin">This is the French faſhion.</note> putting a woollen Cap upon it, having firſt put upon the mould of the Head a fine Linnen rag, three or four double, and four Fingers broad; which that it may not ſtir, pin to the Biggen with a ſmall Pin on the outſide, that it may not prick the Child: this double Rag ſerves to defend the Childs Brain (which is not as yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over in this place with a Bone) as well from cold, as other injuries: Let her put ſmall Rags be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Ears, to dry up the filth which uſually is there ingendred; this done, let her put other rags, as well upon the Breaſt, as in the folds of the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:171433:215"/>
Arm-pits and Groyns, and ſo ſwathe it, having wrapped it up in beds and warm blankets. It is not neceſſary to give a particular direction how this ought to be done, becauſe it is ſo common, that there is ſcarce a Woman but knowes it, but wee'l only ſay in general, that a Child muſt not be ſwathed too-ſtrait in his Blankets, eſpecially about the Breaſt and Stomach, that ſo he may breath the freelier, and not be forced to vomit up the Milk he ſucks, becauſe the Stomach cannot be ſufficiently extended to contain it; and ſuch a practice may poſſibly in time, converting this vomiting into an habit, prove a very great prejudice to the Child: Wherefore to avoid it, let his Arms and Legs be wrapped in his bed, and ſtretched ſtrait out, and ſwathed to keep them ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> his Arms along his ſides, and his Legs equally both together, with a little of the bed between them, that ſo they may not be galled by rubbing one another; after all this, the Head muſt be kept ſteady and ſtrait, with a ſtay faſtned on each ſide the Blancket, and then wrap the Child up in Mantles or Blankets to keep it warm. He muſt be thus ſwaddled to give his little body a ſtrait Figure, which is moſt decent and convenient for a Man, and to accuſtom him to keep upon the Feet, for elſe he would go upon all four, as moſt other Animals do.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe Excrements mentioned, the Child hath yet a certain clammy Phlegme remaining in its Stomach, which he <hi>pukes</hi> up ſome few daies after he is born: to remedy this, you muſt give the Child a ſmall Spoonful of ſugared Wine, twice or thrice the firſt day together, making him to ſwallow it, and by no means give it ſuck until it
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:171433:216"/>
be moſt part evacuated, or digeſted and conſumed by the Stomach, for fear leſt the Milk mixing with this viſcous humour ſhould corrupt, as it would do, if you gave it preſently ſuck; ſome gives them for this purpoſe a little Oyl of ſweet Almonds, drawn without fire, and a little Sugar-candy: The Jews are accuſtomed to give their Children a little Butter and Honey, which doth almoſt produce the ſame effect; and this they do to follow what is ſaid in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the 14, and 15 Verſes: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a Virgin ſhall conceive &amp; bear a Son, and ſhall call his name</hi> Emanuel; <hi>Butter &amp; Honey ſhall he eat, that he may know to refuſe the Evil, and chuſe the Good.</hi> But Wine is much better, becauſe it doth better cut and looſen this Phlegme, and helps to concoct and digeſt that which remains, and the Sugar ſweetens its Acrimony, and helps to purge it away.</p>
               <p>Now having given it this Medicine, lay it quietly to reſt on his ſide, that the Excrements may be the better evacuated and caſt forth at the Mouth: for if the Child lyes on the back, it would be in danger that remaining in its Mouth, a part of it would fall upon his Breaſt, which might choak him, or at leaſt very much offend him. Let us now ſee how he muſt be fed and ordered hereafter.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of Dieting and Ordering a new-born Babe.</head>
               <p>A Child, which during its ſtay in the Mothers Belly, had no other nouriſhment but the blood
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:171433:216"/>
it receives by the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Veſſels, hath for want of that, after its Birth, need to take ſome by the Mouth, and ſuck Breaſt-milk: However it is not good to give it ſuck aſſoon as it is born, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that ſo ſudden a change, as well in reſpect of the difference of nouriſhment, as the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, leſt it cauſe ſome alteration in its health. Firſt therefore empty the Phlegm out of his Stomach, giving him, as we have ſaid, the firſt <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> daies, ſome Wine and Sugar, to cut and looſen it, to prevent the Milk he ſhall take from corrupting, being mixt with this viſcous Phlegme; wherefore it is beſt to ſtay until the next day before you give it ſuck, that ſo it may be wholly evacuated, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted and conſumed, and then you may ſafely give him the Breaſt.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſhed that the Mother ſhould not give it ſuck, until the eighth day of her Child-bed at ſooneſt, if not three Weeks or a Month; that ſo all the humours of her Body, being well tempered, and having recovered the agitation they received in the Travail, as alſo their Superfluities having been wholly purged by means of the <hi>Lochia,</hi> her Milk be thereby ſo much the more purified; beſides this the ſmall holes of the Nipples not yet being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently opened, a new-born Babe cannot ordinarily at firſt eaſily draw her Breaſts; during that time therefore let a Woman ſuck her.</p>
               <p>But often poor people cannot obſerve ſo many Precautions, and ſuch Mothers are obliged to give their Children ſuck from the firſt day: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe others will not ſuffer any but themſelves to do it: in this caſe, let their Breaſts be a little drawn by ſome old perſons, or ſome luſty ſucking Child;
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:171433:217"/>
or they may draw them themſelves with a Glaſs, figured like that in the beginning of the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chap. and afterwards they may give their Children ſuck when the Milk is a little brought down; let them continue to do thus, 'till the Milk be eaſy for the new-born Child to draw.</p>
               <p>There are ſome who believe that the Milk of a Woman new-laid is better at the beginning than when it is purified, and that it opens the Belly and purgeth the <hi>Moeconion</hi> from the Guts; but the gripes, which this overheated and foul Milk alſo cauſeth in him, is much more prejudicial than the good it otherwiſe doth; wherefore it is beſt not to give it ſuch new-milk, if poſſible. As to the fitteſt time then of giving the Breaſt to the new-born Babe, it muſt not be till after the firſt day, for the reaſons above given; and to make him take it, becauſe there are ſome that will not in three or four daies, the Nurſe muſt milk a little into his Mouth and upon his Lips, that ſo he may by degrees taſte it, then let her put the Nipple dropping into its Mouth, and ſqueeze her Breaſt with her Hand when he hath faſtened, that the Milk may come down the eaſier, and that the Infant who hath yet but ſmall ſtrength, may not take too much pains to draw and ſuck it, doing thus dy degrees, until he is well accuſtomed to ſuck.</p>
               <p>If the Nurſe hath much Milk, ſhe muſt not give the Child any thing elſe, at leaſt the firſt two Months; Beaſts do ſhew us, that Milk alone is ſufficient to nouriſh an Infant, ſince that they do ſuckle five or ſix of their young ones, and ſometimes more, without their taking any other food for a long time after. As to the quantity of Milk a Child
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:171433:217"/>
ought to ſuck, it muſt be proportionable to his Age and Strength; in the beginning he muſt not have too much, nor too often, that his Stomach not yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to concoct it, may the better digeſt it; afterwards let it daily by little and little be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, until he may take his fill: As to the time and hour it needs no limits, for it may be at any time, night or day, when he hath a mind; but let him have it rather little and often, than too-much at a time, that his little Stomach may the better concoct and digeſt it without Vomiting, as it often doth when it cannot eaſily contain it.</p>
               <p>After the Child hath ſuck'd Milk alone for two or three Months, more or leſs, according as one finds he needs ſtronger nouriſhment, give him then Pap, made of Flower and Milk, though but little at firſt, and not too thick, leſt his Stomach be ſoon overcharged by not being uſed to it; or (that it may be of eaſier digeſtion) put the Meal in an earthen Pan, into an Oven aſſoon as the bread is drawn, ſtirring it often, to dry it equally. Pap made of this Flower, beſides that it is ſooner concocted, is much better than the ordinary, which is heavier, clammier, and not ſo eaſy of digeſtion; for being made with raw Flower, 'tis very difficult to boil it well, without conſuming the beſt part of the Milk, leaving only the groſſeſt part behind, and loſing by the long boiling both its goodneſs and taſte. When the Child hath taken Pap thus made, which muſt be but once a day, eſpecially in the morning, or twice at moſt, the Nurſe may give it a little ſuck, to the end that being waſhed down into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the digeſtion may be the better and eaſier made.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:171433:218"/>There are many Women who give Pap to their Children aſſoon as they are born, and Nurſes who have little Milk ordinarily do ſo, to hinder their crying as they will do when they are hungry; but ſomtimes this only is enough to kill them, becauſe of the indigeſtion and obſtruction it cauſeth, which by reaſon of its groſs and viſcous conſiſtence, can hardly find paſſage through the Stomach and Guts, which at the beginning are but weak, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently opened and dilated, whereby there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to the Children great oppreſſions, and difficulty of Breathing, Gripes, Swellings, pains of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and often Death; wherefore do not give it the Child 'till after the firſt or ſecond Moneth at ſooneſt, and if you forbore it three or four whole Moneths, he would thrive the better, provided the Nurſe wants no Milk.</p>
               <p>When the Child hath ſucked its fill, let the Nurſe lay it to reſt and ſleep, not in the ſame Bed ſhe lies in, leſt unawares ſhe overlay it; as I knew one that did and killed her Child, whether wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be freed from it, or innocently, ſhe alone knoweth: but to avoid this miſchief, let her lay it in a Cradle cloſe by the Bed-ſide, and put a Mantle over the head of the Cradle to prevent the falling of duſt on its Face, and that the Day-light, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, Candle, or Fire in the Chamber, may not offend it. Lay him to ſleep upon his Back, with his Head a little raiſed upon a Pillow; and to make him ſleep the ſooner, let the Nurſe rock him gently with an equal motion, without too-great ſhaking; leſt that hindering the digeſtion of the Milk in his Stomach, provoke him to vomit it up, juſt as perſons do that are at Sea; not becauſe of the ſcent of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:171433:218"/>
the Salt-water, but the ſhaking and toſſing of the Ship wherein they are; and as it happens to many Women only by riding in a Coach, when they are not uſed to it. But that you may not be forced thus to rock a Child every time you would have him ſleep, it is good not to uſe him to it at firſt, but let his ſleep come naturally of it ſelf. There needs no certain limited time for his reſt, for he may ſleep at any time night or day when he hath a mind to it, and ordinarily the better he is, the more he ſleeps; however, if his ſleep be very immoderate, it may be a little broken; to which purpoſe let his Nurſe carry him in her Arms to the light, ſinging with a ſoft and ſweet voice, ſhewing him ſome gliſtering thing to pleaſe his ſight, and dancing him a little to awake him out of his drowſineſs; for by too long Sleep, the natural Heat doth ſo retire inwards, that it is as it were buried there, by means of which all the Body, and chiefly the Brain, is ſo cooled, that the Infants Senſes are thereby quite dull, and their functions languiſhing and ſtupified.</p>
               <p>When he is in the Cradle, let it be ſo turned as it may be towards the Fire, the Candle, or the Chamber Window, that having the light directly in its Face, he may not be allured to look continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on one ſide; for doing ſo often, his ſight will be ſo perverted, that he will grow ſquint-eyed: Wherefore for the better ſecurity, throw ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering over the head of the Bed, as we have ſaid, to hinder him from ſeeing the light; becauſe by this means, his ſight being ſtaied from rouling from ſide to ſide, will be the better fortified. Let us now ſee how a Nurſe muſt daily cleanſe her Child from the Excrements.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:171433:219"/>As the young of all other Animals have their bodies free, without the trouble of any coverings, ſo they eaſily diſcharge themſelves of their Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without being befouled; and they no ſooner empty their Belly, but their Dam (if they cannot do it themſelves) perceiving it, caſts it forth of their Neſt, or at leſt rangeth it in ſome one part, where it cannot hurt them: but it is not the ſame with Infants, who (for being bound and ſwathed with Swathes and Blankets, as we are forced, to give them a ſtrait Figure only ſuitable to mankind) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not render their Excrements, but at the ſame time they muſt be befouled, and in which, (becauſe it cannot be perceived for their Clothes) they often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, until the ill ſcent of it offends the Nurſes noſe; or that ſhe doubts it, becauſe of the Cryes and Tears of the Child, which is incommoded by the Moiſtneſs and Acrimony of it; to avoid which let the Child be opened and changed, at leaſt twice or thrice a day, and alſo ſometimes in the night, if neceſſary, to cleanſe him from his Excrements, and change the bed, which ought to be well waſhed, and not ſlightly, as moſt part of hired Nurſes do, which cauſeth a great itching, and galleth the Childs body, becauſe of a certain ſalt coming from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and not eaſie to be diſſolved when the Blanket hath once imbued it, but by putting it into a Bucking-tub. The beſt time to ſhift the Child is immediatly after the Excrements are rendred, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering him to lye longer in them, than 'till he awakes, if he were then aſleep.</p>
               <p>Now ſince he may render them at any hour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, no other time can be appointed to do it,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:171433:219"/>
but when there is no need, that is, as often as it is neceſſary to keep him alwaies clean.</p>
               <p>The Child muſt alwaies be opened before the fire, and his Beds and Clouts well warmed and dried, before he be put into them, leſt their coldneſs and moiſture cauſe a Cholick and Gripes; the Nurſe likewiſe muſt be careful from time to time to put ſoft Rags behind the Ears and under the Arm-pits, to dry up the moiſture there found, being very careful, during the firſt four or five daies, not to make the remaining part of the Navel-ſtring fall off too ſoon, and before the Veſſels of it be perfectly cloſed. Let her likewiſe ſee every time ſhe opens him, whether the Navel, for want of being well tyed at firſt, do not bleed, or becauſe the thread is looſened; and after the end is quite fallen off, let her ſtill for ſome time ſwath the Navel, ever laying a boulſter on the top of it, until it be well cicatriced and wholly depreſſed, and as it were ſunk inwards. Beſides this, let her put upon the Mould of the head, under the Biggen, another Compreſs, as well to keep the Brain warm, as to defend it from outward Injuries which might eaſily hurt it, becauſe of the tenderneſs of that place not yet covered over with any bone; let her alſo be very careful not to let the Child cry too-much, eſpecially at firſt, leſt the Navel be forced outwards, and that there happen to him by its dilatation an <hi>Exomphale,</hi> or a rupture in the Groine; nor muſt ſhe hearken to the ſayings of ſome good people, who affirm it neceſſary a Child ſhould ſometimes cry, to diſcharge its Brain: the two beſt waies to quiet him when he cryes, is to give him ſuck, and lay him clean and dry; 'tis likewiſe good to preſent to his ſight things that rejoyce him,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:171433:220"/>
and to remove what may affright, or grieve him.</p>
               <p>All theſe directions in this preſent Chapter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Diet and Order of a new-born Babe, muſt be underſtood for one in health; for if he be any waies indiſpoſed, he muſt be treated according as the caſe requires.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of the Indiſpoſitions of little Children, and firſt of their weakneſs.</head>
               <p>YOung Trees are ſcarce raiſed out of the Earth, which is their Mother, but often many of them ſoon after dye; becauſe their ſmall bodies, by reaſon of the tenderneſs of their ſubſtance, eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive alteration, and cannot without great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty reſiſt the ſmalleſt oppoſition, until they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a little bigger, and have taken ſtronger and deeper root: So likewiſe we ſee daily above half of the young Children dye, before they are two or three years old; as well becauſe of the tenderneſs of their Bodies, as by reaſon of the feebleneſs of their Age, they cannot otherwiſe expreſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities they ſuffer within, but by their cryes. We have heretofore diſcovered how they ought to be governed in the beginning for the preſervation of a good health; we will now diſcourſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions to which they are ſubject, principally from their birth, 'till they are ſeven or eight
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:171433:220"/>
Months old. Let us firſt mention ſome they are born with, and then wee'l entertain you with thoſe that uſually happen to them afterwards.</p>
               <p>The firſt Accident to be remedied is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs many Children bring into the world with them; which often happens, not becauſe they are ſo by Nature, but by the violence of a bad Labour, or the length of it, during which they ſuffer ſo much, that ſometimes after they are born they are ſo weak, that it is hard to be diſcovered whether they are dead or alive, not any part of their Body being perceived to ſtir, which ſometimes is ſo blew and livid, eſpecially the Face, that one would think they were quite choaked. And many times, after they have been thus for whole hours, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover by little and little from their weakneſs, as if they revived, and were returned from Death to Life.</p>
               <p>One may gueſs that the Child is not effectually dead, although at firſt it doth in ſome ſort appear ſo to be; if the Woman but a little before ſhe was brought to Bed felt it to ſtir ſtrongly; if ſhe did not flood much, and if ſhe had no very hard Labour: but 'tis very certain he is yet living, although he do not cry, nor move any part of his Body after he is born; if laying the hand upon his Breaſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart be felt; or touching the Navel-ſtring near the Belly, there is yet perceived a ſmall pulſation of the Arteries: Then all ſorts of means muſt be uſed to recover him out of this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Now the beſt help in this caſe is, to lay him ſpeedily in a warm Bed and Blanket, and carry him to the fire, and there let the Midwife ſup ſome

Wine, and ſpout it into his Mouth, repeating it often if there be occaſion; let her likewiſe lay Linnen, dipt in warm Wine, to the Breaſt and Belly; let the Face be uncovered, that he may draw breath the eaſier; and to be yet more helpfull to him, let the Midwife keep his Mouth a little open, and cleanſe the Noſtrils with ſmall linen tents, alſo dipt in white Wine, that ſo he may receive the ſmell of it; let her chafe every part of his Body well with warm Clothes, to bring back the Blood and Spirits, which for being retired inwards through weakneſs, put him in danger of being choaked: in doing thus by little and little, the Infant recovering his ſtrength, will inſenſibly come to ſtirr his Limbs one after another, and ſo at firſt cry but weakly, which afterwards, as he breaths freer, will augment and become ſtronger.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe helps we have mentioned, which certainly are the beſt and moſt certain for the weakneſs of a new-born Babe, Midwives ordinarily make uſe of others, which I do not approve of, not only becauſe they are uſeleſs, but becauſe ſome of them are very dangerous to the Child. Some lay the After-burthen, being very warm, to the Belly, and leave it there 'till it is cold. I have elſewhere declared, that the Burthen, by reaſon of its heat, may be ſomething ſerviceable; but notwithſtanding, becauſe of its weight, being ſo placed upon the Childs Belly, which wanting a ſupport is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily compreſſed, it doth very much hinder his reſpiration, which at that time is moſt neceſſary for him. Others caſt the <hi>Secondine</hi> into the Fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be parted, and ſome put it in warm Wine, believing that by this means the ſtrength of the Wine
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:171433:221"/>
conveighed through the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Veſſels, is able to give him new vigour: But as this fleſhy Maſs, and theſe Veſſels, are dead parts aſſoon as they are out of the Womb, ſo there remains in them no ſpirits which can be communicated to the Infant: And if this practice be continued, it muſt rather be to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie cuſtome, than for any hope of benefit to be thereby received.</p>
               <p>If theſe things do no good, yet do they no great hurt, but are only uſeleſs; but this which follows is capable to ſuffocate a Child immediately, that is, when ſome do thruſt back, and make the Blood which is in the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Veſſels to enter into the Body, believing that it fortifies and recovers the Child out of its weakneſs; but we have elſewhere declared, that the Blood contained in theſe Veſſels loſe their ſpirits aſſoon as the <hi>Secondine</hi> is ſeparated and come forth of the Womb; nay, it is there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after, half congealed: Now if it be thus thruſt back into a weak Childs Liver, it remains there, being no longer animated with any ſpirits, and inſtead of giving him new ſtrength, it overcomes that little which remains, and compleats the extinction of his languiſhing natural heat: to avoid this, be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to force back the Blood thus into the Infants Belly, for beſides in theſe weakneſſes, (unleſs it ſhould be otherwaies by the Mothers flooding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was brought to Bed) there is alwaies too much of it in the Infants body, and inſtead of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more to it, there muſt be ſome drawn back from it towards the extremities, that ſo its Ventricles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little diſcharged, may have afterwards a more free motion to ſend back the ſpirits to all parts, which are deprived of them by theſe faintings:
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:171433:222"/>
Wherefore ſince the Child muſt receive nothing from the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbilical</hi> Veſſels after its Birth, let them be tyed aſſoon as may be, and then ordered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we have directed.</p>
               <p>Very often the Children which are weak at their Birth, are ſo by nature; as when they come before their time, and are ſo much the weaker, by how much they want to compleat the end of the ninth Moneth, and alſo when they are begotten by infirm and ſick parents.</p>
               <p>Theſe are hard to remedy, and there is nothing more to be done, but to nouriſh and order them well according to our former directions; but it will be rare for them to be long-lived, and it is much if they do not dye by the leaſt indiſpoſition that befalls their natural weakneſs.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Of Contuſions, or Bruiſes of the Head, and other parts of the Body of a new-born Babe.</head>
               <p>THe Bodies of new-born Children, are, as we have ſaid, ſo tender and delicate, that they are eaſily bruiſed and hurt; and ſometimes in a bad Labour their Members are diſlocated, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it remained long in an unnatural Poſture; or becauſe they were handled too rudely in the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the moſt uſual and frequent bruiſe is for the moſt part on the top of their Head, where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at their Birth, they have a Knob, as big as
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:171433:222"/>
half an Egg, if not bigger, as is uſually ſeen in firſt Labours; and which happens the ſooner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Woman is advanced in Age; becauſe the inward orifice of the Womb, called the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, being more <hi>callous,</hi> doth not dilate without much difficulty; for which reaſon, the Childs head preſſing againſt it, and the upper part of it (which naturally preſents firſt to the Paſſage) being begirt with it as with a Garland, is puft up and ſwelled (becauſe of the Blood and Humours which fall down, and are retained in this part) by the great compreſſion which this inward orifice makes round about, eſpecially when the Throwes begin to be ſtrong, and the Child comes but ſlowly forward, after the Waters, which did a little defend it, are broke away; the Midwife alſo may do much ill in it, if ſhe toucheth it too-often, or too-roughly with her Fingers, when it lyes in the Birth; but many times they are in this caſe wrongfully accuſed; becauſe for the moſt part the ſingle compreſſion this orifice makes in form of a Garland about the Childs Head is the cauſe of this kind of bruiſed Tumours.</p>
               <p>This part ſwells after the ſame manner as we ſee all others, which are either too-ſtrongly preſt, bound, or laſed; for by this means, the Blood which cannot circulate, being ſtopt in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in one part, obligeth it to ſwell and be blown up; and, by the repletion it makes, renders it livid, as if it were bruiſed: Now this compreſſion is much greater in reſpect of the Veins, which are alwaies more outward, and ought to carry back the Blood to the Heart, than of the Arteries, by means of which it is carried to all the parts; for beſides
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:171433:223"/>
that the Arteries lye deeper, they have alſo a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Pulſation, by the favour of which a little Blood ever ſlides away; and this is the reaſon that in all Compreſſions or Ligatures of parts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be not too-hard, the Blood is eaſily carried into them by the Arteries, and but very hardly, or not at all, carried back by the Veins; which is the reaſon that the part receiving much more than it ſends back or conſumes for its nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt needs ſwell on this faſhion by Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If they that practiſe Midwifery do but well conſider what I have ſaid, when occaſion offers, which is very often, they will find that theſe kind of Knobs or Tumours, which many Children have on their Head at their birth, proceed ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily from no other cauſe than what I have here explained.</p>
               <p>Theſe Tumours many times are ſo great and high, that (the Woman not being yet delivered, nor having the inner Orifice of the Womb well dilated) they do hinder the diſcovery of the part the Infant firſt preſents, making Midwives ſometimes to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, not being able to feel any bone of the Head with their Finger, that it is the Childs Shoulder, or ſome other part, nay ſome of them cannot tell what that ſwelling is they feel: but they may ſoon know it, by reaſon theſe Tumours, though feeling very fleſhy at the touch, are notwithſtanding harder than any Shoulder, or Buttock of a Child, which parts are alwaies more ſoft and without hair, as the Head hath, the Bones of which may alſo be eaſily perceived, if having the Finger anointed with Oyl or freſh Butter, it can be introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:171433:223"/>
the inner orifice, for the parts of the Head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Womb, are not ſwelled, 'tis only this which offers to the Orifice, and is preſt and begirt by it, as we have ſaid. If a Child comes with any other part beſides the Head, as an Arm or a Leg, and that theſe parts likewiſe remain a long time preſt in the Paſſage, and in a poſture much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, or that they be come forth, they likewiſe ſwell for the ſame reaſon.</p>
               <p>There muſt not only be Remedies applied to theſe Knobs and Bruiſes of young Childrens Heads, but endeavours muſt be to prequent them, or at leaſt to hinder them from becoming ſo big: the means to prevent them, is to procure the Delivery aſſoon as may be, that the Infants Head may not reſt ſo too long, and be ſtraitned by the Garland of the inner orifice of the Womb, which muſt be well anointed with Oile, or <hi>Emollient</hi> Ointment, as well to further its dilatation, as that the Head may the ſooner and the eaſier paſs.</p>
               <p>Some may object, That if theſe Tumours happen, from the cauſe I have mentioned, they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear aſſoon as the Infant is born, becauſe then the Head being no longer preſt, nothing hinders the Blood, which had rumefied the part, from return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having its motion free: But they muſt know, that by its too long ſtay it makes in one part, it looſeth the ſpirits which are there ſuffocated, of which being deſtitute, it can no longer move, and being extravaſed without the Veſſels, out of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural place, (as it will be, when the Veſſels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it are too full) it ſlides into all the little vacuities of the part, for which cauſe it cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:171433:224"/>
return by the ordinary waies; wherefore there is a neceſſity in this caſe, either that it be reſolved through the part, or if it ſtay any time, that it comes to <hi>Suppuration;</hi> which however muſt be avoided, if it be poſſible, becauſe of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Brain, which in Infants is not covered over with the Skull at the <hi>Sutures,</hi> which are alwaies very open, eſpecially towards the Mould.</p>
               <p>To reſolve theſe Tumours then, aſſoon as the Child is born, foment them with warm Wine, or <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> and wetting a Compreſs in it, put it upon them; ſome Mid-wives only dip a Compreſs in Oyl and Wine beat together; others in Oyl of Roſes onely, having firſt fomented them with Wine: but if, notwithſtanding this, they come to Suppuration, the matter muſt not be ſuffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there too long, for fear leſt the bones of the Head (which are very tender and thin in new-born Children) become altered and ſoule; in this caſe, it muſt be opened with a Lancet in a proper place, according to Art, putting upon it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Plaiſter of <hi>Bettony;</hi> if a Leg or an Arm be thus ſwelled, it muſt likewiſe be wrap'd up with Compreſſes dipt in Wine, wherein <hi>Provence</hi>-Roſes, <hi>Camomil</hi>-Flowers and <hi>Melilot</hi> have been boyled.</p>
               <p>Sometimes alſo Male-children have the <hi>Scrotum</hi> very much ſwelled, which may happen to them by reaſon of ſome Waters contained in their <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes;</hi> or becauſe they were bruiſed, or too rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled by the Chirurgeon, or Midwife, in the Labour. In theſe caſes, Compreſſes dipt in Wine with Roſes, are very proper to both.</p>

               <p>VEry often Children, who come before their time, not having yet acquired their full perfection, as alſo they which are by nature weak, have the Mould of their Head, and the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> ſo open, by the diſtance and ſeparation of the Bones one from another, that it is very ſoft and almoſt without any ſupport, becauſe the Bones eaſily yeild to every ſide; theſe Children are not uſually long-lived. One muſt not think then to bring the bones cloſe together, by binding the Head ſtrait, for this would ſo preſſe the Brain, which is very tender, that it would cauſe a worſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, in taking away the liberty of its motion, whereby its functions would be depraved, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards totally aboliſhed. It will be ſufficient to bind them ſoftly with a ſmall Croſs-cloth, leſt they ſhould be too unſteady, and commit the reſt
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:171433:226"/>
to Natures work, which by degrees will cloſe up theſe <hi>Sutures</hi> (in finiſhing to ingender) and dry up and unite theſe bones of the Head, which were not hitherto perfectly formed.</p>
               <p>The place where the <hi>Sagittal Suture</hi> joins and terminates, in the midſt of the <hi>Coronal,</hi> which it alwaies in every Child divides in two, continuing to the very root of the Noſe, is called<note n="*" place="margin">Mould.</note> the Fountain of the Head, becauſe 'tis the ſofteſt and moiſteſt part of it, which for this reaſon is the laſt dryed and cloſed up. The Figure of it is repreſented in the Head, placed at the beginning of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>There are Children who have it ſometimes open 'till they are three years old, if not longer, which is a great ſign of the weakneſs of their natural Heat. It is uſually quite cloſed up at the end of two years, and ſooner or later, according as the Infant is more or leſs moiſt, or more or leſs ſtrong. Until theſe Bones are entirely cloſed, 'tis conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenient to lay upon that place (as we have already elſewhere directed) a Linnen Compreſs three or four double, to defend the Head, as well from Cold, as other external injuries. Some Women keep a piece of Scarlet cloath a long time to it, thinking that it doth ſtrengthen the part more; 'tis no matter what one uſes, provided it will keep the Brain warm, and hinder any hurt in that place, which is not as yet covered over with any bone.</p>
               <p>It happens ſometimes, that although the bones of the Head be big enough to unite in all parts, if they were not hindred, they are however extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtant one from the other in the place of the

When the Waters are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Skin and the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> or between the <hi>Pericranium</hi> and the Skull; the Children may be cured of it, if the Tumour be not too great, by reſolving of theſe Waters, or emptying them by an Inciſion: but if they are in great abundance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bones, between them and the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> thruſting them ſo outwards, and enlarging the <hi>Sutures,</hi> the Children cannot eſcape it; which is yet ſo much the more impoſſible, if the Waters are contained between the <hi>dura</hi> and the <hi>pia mater,</hi> or within the Brain.</p>

               <p>IT happens ſometimes that young Children, as well Male as Female, are born with the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cloſe ſtopt up; for which reaſon they cannot render nor evacuate neither the new Excrements engendred by the Milk they ſuck, nor the <hi>Moeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> which was amaſſed in their Inteſtines, whilſt they were in the Mothers Belly; of which Diſeaſe they certainly dye, if not ſpeedily remedied.
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:171433:227"/>
There have likewiſe ſometimes been Girles, who, having the Fundament cloſed, yet voided the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the Guts by an orifice, which nature, to ſupply its defect, had made within the <hi>Vagina,</hi> or Neck of the Womb.</p>
               <p>Now the Fundament is cloſed two waies; either by a ſimple Membrane, as the ſingle Skin, through which one may perceive ſome livid marks, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the retained Excrements; and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with a Finger, there is felt a ſoftneſs within, whereabouts it ought to be pierced: or elſs it is quite ſtopt up by a thick fleſhy ſubſtance, and in ſuch ſort, that there appeares nothing without by which its true ſcituation may be denoted.</p>
               <p>When there is nothing but the ſingle Skin which makes this cloſure, the operation is very eaſy, and the Children may eſcape. Then an apertion may be made with a ſmall Inciſion-knife, croſs-waies rather than ſimple or long, that it may the better receive a round form; and that the place may not afterwards grow together, being very careful not to hurt the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the <hi>Rectum.</hi> The Inciſion being thus made, the Excrements will certainly have iſſue: but if becauſe of their long ſtay in the Belly being become dry, the Infant cannot void them, ſome ſmall Clyſter muſt be given it to moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten and bring them away; afterwards put a linnen tent into the new made Fundament, leſt it cloſe again, which muſt be at firſt anointed with Honey of Roſes, and towards the end with a drying and <hi>cicatrizing</hi> Ointment, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum album,</hi> or <hi>Pompholix;</hi> obſerving to cleanſe the Infant of his Excrements, and dreſs it again aſſoon and as often as he renders them, for fear leſt their ſtaying too
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:171433:227"/>
long there, may turn the Apertion into a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Ulcer.</p>
               <p>If the Fundament be ſo ſtopt up, that neither marke, nor appearance is ſeen or felt, then the Operation is much more difficult; and although it be done, it is a great hazard if the Infant eſcapes it: wherefore if it be a Girl, which empties her Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the <hi>Vagina,</hi> as it ſometimes happens, 'tis better not to meddle with it, than by endeavouring to help an inconvenience, cauſe the Childs death; but when there is no vent for the Excrements, there is a neceſſity to come to the Operation, though it be very perillous, without which death would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly follow.</p>
               <p>To do this well, although there be no outward marks of a fit place, becauſe of the thickneſs of the fleſh which is upon the Inteſtine, let the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon with a ſmall Inciſion-knife, that hath but one edge, enter into the void place, and turning the back of it upwards, within half a Fingers breadth of the Childs Rump, which is the place where he will certainly find the Inteſtine, let him thruſt it ſo forward, that it may be open enough to give free vent to the matters there contained; being alwaies very careful of the <hi>Sphincter,</hi> after which let the wound be dreſſed according as we have above directed, having regard to the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which may follow.</p>
               <p>When it happens, as it is very poſſible, that the Urinary paſſage, as well of Male as Female, is ſtopt up, the like Apertion muſt be made to give paſſage to the Urine contained in the Bladder, and afterwards a ſmall Leaden pipe muſt be introduced into it, to keep the paſſage open until the Inciſion
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:171433:228"/>
there made by a Lancet be cicatrized: but as it is very difficult to have ſuch a Pipe retained in a little Boys yard, which becauſe it is ſo ſhort, will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no proper ſwathing, it may be let alone, ſince the Urine which he renders at all hours, will hinder the Apertion from cloſing.</p>

               <p>THe Tongue is naturally tied with a Ligament ſufficiently ſtrong, faſtened juſt underneath in the middle of it, to be in ſtead of a ſupport; upon which being ſuſtained, it may make all its different motions on either ſide: this Ligament ought to leave it an entire freedom, of being carried and ſupported in all places of the Mouth: wherefore it muſt not be ſo ſhort nor ſo faſtened, but at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient diſtance from its extremity, which muſt be perfectly free on all ſides: But often new-born Babes have before it a ſmall membranous producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, uſually called the String, which is continued almoſt to the end of their Tongue, and taking away the liberty of its motion, hinders them from ſucking with eaſe; becauſe the Tongue, being kept down and as it were bridled with this thread, the Infant cannot move it upwards (as it is neceſſary) to preſs the Nipple with it againſt the Pallat, and to ſuck it to draw the Milk, neither can it move it commodiouſly to ſwallow it afterwards.</p>

               <p>MAny Children are ſo griped, that they cannot forbear crying night nor day, for the great pains they feel in their Belly, with which ſome are ſo vext and tormented that they dye of it. 'Tis very often the firſt and moſt common diſtemper which happens to little Infants after their Birth; which in general and for the moſt part comes from the ſudden change of their nouriſhment, foraſmuch as having alwaies received it by the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Veſſels, whiles they were in their Mothers Belly, they come to change it of a ſudden, not only the manner of receiving it, but the nature and quality of it aſſoon as they are born; for inſtead of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Blood only, which was conveyed to them by means of the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Vein, they are obliged for want of it to be nouriſhed with their Mothers Breaſt-milk, which they ſuck with their Mouth, and from which are engendered many Excrements, cauſing the Gripes, as well becauſe it is not ſo pure as the Blood with which it was fed in the Womb; as becauſe the Stomach and Inteſtines cannot yet make a good Digeſtion, nor an eaſie Diſtribution, being not accuſtomed to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:171433:230"/>The particular cauſes of theſe Gripes are, either when the <hi>Moeconion</hi> (amaſſed during all the time of Pregnancy) is not evacuated ſoon after the Infants birth, and that by its too-long ſtay in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, it acquires a ſharp and pricking Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; or that becoming hard, the Infant cannot void it, nor the new Excrements which proceed from the Milk, which he hath taken at the firſt: 'tis alſo ſometimes becauſe the Child not being able to ſuck with eaſe, he ſwallows, in ſucking the Milk with difficulty, much air and wind, which being retained in the Stomach, and ſliding into the Inteſtines, doth painfully diſtend them. This Wind ſometimes is cauſed, when a Child takes a greater quantity of Milk than he can digeſt; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its ill quality, as when the Woman gives her Breaſt-milk aſſoon as ſhe is delivered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtaying to have it purified: Cold may alſo make it ſuffer the ſame. But very often it is for giving him Pap too ſoon, as alſo when it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough boiled; becauſe this nouriſhment, which is groſs and viſcous, cannot be eaſily digeſted by a new-born Babe, whoſe Stomach is not yet accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to it; and Worms, that are engendred in the Inteſtines, by their ſtirring and biting do alſo much torment them. Beſides all theſe things already mentioned, the Midwife alſo may cauſe great pains in the Childs Belly, by driving back into it the cold and clodded Blood out of the Navel-ſtring before it be tyed.</p>
               <p>For to remedy all theſe pains in the Belly, which Women uſually call all by one common name of Gripes, reſpect muſt be had to their different cauſes: as to that which is the general cauſe, the

too ſudden change of the nouriſhment. To avoid it, one muſt forbear giving the Child ſuck, until the next day, leſt the Milk being mixt with the Phlegm which is then in the Stomach, corrupt; and at firſt it muſt ſuck but little, until it be accuſtomed to digeſt it. If it be the <hi>Moeconion</hi> of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines which by its long ſtay cauſeth theſe pains; for to help to diſcharge them of it, give them at the Mouth a little Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and Syrup of Roſes, as we have directed before; and to provoke it further, give it <hi>Beets</hi>-ſtalk, covered over with Honey, for a Suppoſitory; or a ſugar'd Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond alſo dipt in common Honey: or one may give it a ſmall Clyſter.</p>
               <p>If a Child cannot ſuck with eaſe, regard muſt be had to that which hinders it; for if it be Tongue-tyed, it muſt be cut, as is above directed; and if it be becauſe the Nurſe is hard milcht, change her for one whoſe Milk is better purified; and let her rather ſuckle it a little and often, than more at once than the little Stomach can eaſily digeſt at a time. And above all whiles the Child is griped give it no Pap; becauſe this food, by its viſcoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, doth eaſily cauſe obſtructions, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards engender Wind. If it be Wormes, lay a cloath, dipt in Oyle of <hi>Wormwood</hi> mixt with Ox-gall, upon the Belly; or a ſmall <hi>Cataplaſme</hi> mixt with Powders of <hi>Rue, Wormwood, Coloquint, Aloes,</hi> and the ſeed of <hi>Citrons,</hi> incorporated with Ox-gal and flower of <hi>Lupines;</hi> and to draw &amp; drive them more downwards, if the little Infant can take any thing by the Mouth, give it a ſmall infuſion of <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> or half an Ounce of compound Syrup of <hi>Succory;</hi> having before given it a ſmall Clyſter of
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:171433:231"/>
ſugar'd Milk: for by this means the Wormes, which ſhun the bitterneſs of the Medicines, and ſeek after the ſweetneſs of the Milk, are eaſily brought away by Stool.</p>
               <p>When theſe Gripes are cauſed by Wind, as it often happens, or by any ſharp Humours in the Inteſtines, anoint the Childs Belly all over with Oyl of <hi>Violets,</hi> or with Oyl of ſweet <hi>Almonds,</hi> or elſe with Oyl of <hi>Walnuts, Camomil,</hi> and <hi>Melilot</hi> mixt together, having firſt warm'd them, in which alſo a Cloath may be dipt to lay upon it; or a ſmall Pancake may be made with an Egg or two fried in Oyl of Walnuts, for to be applied to it; and they may take a little <hi>Anodine</hi> or <hi>Carminative</hi> Clyſter, according as the cauſe of the Gripes is known; above all, ever keeping the Child very warm.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Of the Inflamation, Ulceration, or ſhooting forth, or rupture of the Navel of a young Infant.</head>
               <p>THe continual cries of little Children, becauſe of the Pains and Gripes which they feel at the beginning, doth ſomtimes cauſe ſuch an agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Belly, that the Navel-ſtring falling off too ſoon, and before it be entirely cloſed and cicatrized, there happens there an Inflammation and Ulceration; at other times alſo for the ſame
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:171433:232"/>
reaſon, although it be outwardly healed, not being ſo within, it is dilated and thruſt outward the bigneſſe of a ſmall Egg, and ſometimes bigger, which is uſually called <hi>Exomphale,</hi> or ſhooting forth of the Navel.</p>
               <p>There are ſome who imagine when it is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and ulcerated, that it was becauſe the String was tied too-near the Belly, which cauſed a great pain and inflamation to follow: Others ſay that Nature having uſed to diſcharge the Urine by this part, during the Childs being in the Mothers Belly, doth at firſt ſtill continue to ſend it this way, and that it cauſeth this Accident by its acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, for which there is no reaſon: for 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the Urine ſhould regorge from the Bladder to the Navel by the <hi>Urachus;</hi> foraſmuch as it is not hollow in an humane <hi>Foetus,</hi> as we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where made appear. And how near the Belly ſoever the Navel-ſtring is tied, and how hard (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſome of the true skin, which is ſenſible, be not alſo tied with it) it can cauſe no manner of pain to the Child; becauſe it is a dead and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate part aſſoon as a Child is born, and likewiſe inſenſible; becauſe there is no Nerve diſtributed into it. But this Inflamation uſually comes, as I have mentioned, becauſe the Infant, feeling the great pains and gripes in his Belly, doth continually cry, and thereby hinders the Navel from healing: it may likewiſe be cauſed by a violent and frequent Cough, becauſe by theſe efforts, the Blood is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced back into the remaining end of the <hi>Umbilical</hi> Vein, which it alwaies keeps dilated, and being corrupted by its ſtay there, failes not to make an inflammation of the Navel, and that which was
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:171433:232"/>
tyed coming to fall off before it was perfectly heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there remains a very bad Ulcer, upon which ſometimes follows great loſs of Blood, and it may be Death.</p>
               <p>The principal thing to be obſerved in the cure of this Malady, is to appeaſe the Cough, and quiet the Childs crying, reſpecting that which cauſeth it, without which it would daily increaſe; and if it were the Gripes, it muſt be remedied, as is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the foregoing Chapter: as to the reſt, if the Navel be inflamed, one muſt lay upon it <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum refrigerans Galeni,</hi> mixt with as much <hi>Populeon;</hi> or a ſmall Boulſter dipt in Oyl of Roſes with a little Vinegar: <hi>Unguentum Roſatum &amp; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum,</hi> mixt together, is alſo good for it. If the Navel continues ulcered, after the String is fallen off, <hi>Deficcative</hi> and <hi>Aſtringent</hi> Medicines muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to it, ſuch as is ſmall Rags dipt in <hi>Lime</hi> water which is not too ſtrong, or <hi>Plantane</hi> water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little <hi>Allom</hi> hath been diſſolved. If the Ulcer be ſmall, a Pledgit of dry Lint will be ſufficient. Many put to it only a little powder of a <hi>Poſt.</hi> Theſe things are better for this purpoſe than Plaiſters, which are never ſo drying, becauſe of the Oyles and Greaſe which enter into their compoſition. But if notwithſtanding one would uſe them, he may take <hi>Deſiccativum rubrum,</hi> or <hi>Diapompholigos;</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly obſerving to put a good linnen Compreſs on the top of theſe Remedies, with a Swath to keep them faſt, until the Navel be <hi>ciccatrized</hi> and perfectly healed; leſt beſides its Ulceration, it be forced outwards, and that its Veſſels open by the violence of a great Cough, or by the agitation which the Gripes cauſe in the Childs Belly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:171433:233"/>As to the rupture of the Navel in young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whether great or little, the cure of it muſt not be otherwiſe undertaken than by Swathes and Compreſſes fitted for the purpoſe, 'till they have acquired a more reaſonable Age, when, if the Malady be not cured by the Swathes, the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be done if deſired: But if after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation there growes an Impoſthume, which cauſeth the ſhooting forth of the Navel, and that the tumor of it be very great, then it ever kills the Children, and if it be opened, the matter indeed may be emptied, but there is great danger that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it, the Guts come forth in the ſame place the firſt time the Child cries, which may afterwards perſuade thoſe that underſtand not the Art, that this accident happened through the Chirurgeons ignorance. For this reaſon <hi>Ambroſe Parè</hi> in his 94<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of his Book of Generation, adviſeth you not to meddle with it, but rather to let the Child die, without doing any thing to it, as he ſaith he did himſelf, when he was ſent for by a Taylor in the like caſe.</p>
               <p>He recites in the ſame place a ſtory of a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon of his time, called Mr. <hi>Peter de la Rock,</hi> who was in very great danger of his life, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving opened an Impoſtume of the Navel of a Child of <hi>Monſieur de Martigues,</hi> which being done, the Inteſtines came forth by the orifice, and ſoon after the Child died, which the ſervants of the houſe reported was thereby cauſed, and therefore (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though without reaſon) they would have killed him, if the ſaid Monſieur <hi>de Martigues</hi> had not hindered them: but I believe the Chirurgeon had ſhunned the danger they put him in, and that
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:171433:233"/>
diſgrace, if he had before made a good Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick of what would follow, and the danger wherein the Infant was; for it may be, reſembling many of our time (who undertake ſuch things that they may be thought more able than others, and being but ſimple fellows, boaſt themſelves capable to work miracles) he had promiſed ſpeedily to cure the Child of this Maladie, which was incureable, that (under ſo fair hopes) he might have a good ſumme in hand paid him. In this we muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Parey</hi>'s advice with ſome diſtinction; for, if the Impoſtume be ſmall, and the Child ſtrong, one muſt not forbear, having firſt made a good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtick, to open it; and when there is never ſo little hopes, 'tis better to practiſe what Art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, than to forſake the ſick in a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>

               <p>IF the Nurſe doth not keep the Child very clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not changeing the Beds, or waſhing them each time; or aſſoon as they are fouled with their Excrements, their acrimony will not fail to cauſe redneſs and ſmartings in the Groins, Thighs and Buttocks; and afterwards, becauſe of the pain, theſe parts will inflame, which eaſily happens by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

               <p>The cure of theſe Indiſpoſitions is twofold; (that is) firſt to keep the Child cleanly: and ſecondly to take off the ſharpneſs of its Urine.

               <p>Beſides theſe two generals, cooling and drying Remedies muſt be applyed to the inflamed parts. Wherefore each time the Childs excrements are wip'd off, let the parts be bathed with <hi>Plantane</hi> water, mixt with a fourth part of <hi>Lime</hi>-water; and if the pain be very great, let it only be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with luke-warm Milk.</p>

               <p>VEry frequently the Milk of a Nurſe, that is Red-haired, given to Wine, or very amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, may by its heat and acrimony cauſe ſmall Ulcers in an Infants Mouth, which are called <hi>Aphthae,</hi> and vulgarly <hi>Cancers;</hi> ſometimes alſo though the Milk have no ill quality in it ſelf, it may however corrupt in the Childs Stomach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its weakneſs, or for ſome other indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which acquiring an acrimony, inſtead of being well digeſted, there ariſeth thence biting Vapours, which forming a thick Viſcoſity, ſticking like a kind of white Soot all over the Mouth, doth eaſily cauſe and engender theſe ſmall Ulcers, by reaſon of the tenderneſs and delicacy of it. This, <hi>Guido</hi> makes us take notice of, when he ſaies, that theſe Ulcers for the moſt part happen to Children by the badneſſe of the Milk, or by its ill digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Of theſe Ulcers, ſome are benigne, as they that are cauſed by a ſimple heat of the Nurſes Milk, or by the Childs blood and humours being a little overheated; or alſo for having had a ſmall fit of a Feaver, and they are then very ſuperficial, of ſmall continuance, and eaſily yeilding to Remedies; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are malignant, ſuch as are cauſed by a <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi> Vnome, or that happen after a malignant
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:171433:235"/>
Feaver, and are <hi>Scorbutick,</hi> which are putrid, corroſive, and ſpreading, and do not only poſſeſs the ſuperficies of the <hi>membranes,</hi> which covers the roof of the Mouth and Tongue; but making its Scabs deeper, is communicated to all the internal parts of the Throat, as the <hi>Venereal</hi> ones eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, which can never be cured by ordinary Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but muſt be handled with <hi>Specificks,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they ever augment, and ſoon kill little Infants, who are too weak to undergo the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies fit for their cure.</p>
               <p>The Ulcers of the Mouth, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> are of difficult Cure; becauſe they are in hot and moiſt places, where eaſily Putrefaction and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſion is augmented; beſides the Remedies applied cannot lodg there, being ſoon waſhed away with Spittle.</p>
               <p>To cure theſe Ulcers when they are ſmall and without malignity, you muſt take care to temper and cool the Nurſes milk, preſcribing her a cooling Diet, bleeding and purging her alſo, if there be occaſion; waſh the Childs mouth with Barley or <hi>Plantane</hi>-water, and Honey of Roſes, or Syrup of drie Roſes, mixing with them a little Verjuice, or juice of Lemmons, as well to looſen and cleanſe the viſcous Humours which cleave to the inſide of the Childs mouth, as to cool thoſe parts which are already overheated; this may be done by means of a ſmall fine Rag faſtened to the end of a little ſtick, and dipt in this Remedy, wherewith the Ulcers may be gently rubbed, being careful not to put them to too much pain, leſt irritating of them, an Inflammation be cauſed to augment the malady. The Childs body muſt not be kept open, that the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:171433:235"/>
Humours being carried to the lower parts, ſo many vapors may not aſcend, as uſually do when the Excrements of the Belly are too-long retained.</p>
               <p>If the Ulcers participate of any malignity, let <hi>Topical</hi> Remedies then be uſed, which do their work ſpeedily, and as it were in an inſtant, for to correct the evil qualities of the humours that cauſe them, and prevent their further augmentation; for it being impoſſible if they ſhould remain long in theſe parts, but their effect and vertue would be hindered, or much diminiſhed by the moiſture of the Mouth. For this purpoſe touch the Ulcers with Water of <hi>Plantane</hi> ſharpned with Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> taking great care that the Infant ſwallows none of it; and the Remedy muſt be ſo much the ſtronger and ſharper, as the Ulcers are profound and malignant; aſſoon as they have been cauterized with this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by only touching them once or twice with it, according to their bigneſs, depth, or corruption, that no ſharp <hi>ſeroſities</hi> may diſtill upon the places not yet ulcered, and upon the Infants Throat, waſh its Mouth with <hi>Plantane</hi> water, or with a Decoction of Barley, <hi>Agrimony,</hi> and Honey of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> continuing to touch and waſh the ulcers as it may be judged convenient, and until you find that they ſpread no further. To prevent that in the uſe of theſe ſharp Medicines, not the leaſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them may fall upon the Childs Throat, and that by ſwallowing of them he may receive no great prejudice, ſome chuſe rather to cauterize theſe Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers with ſmall Linnen tents, dipt in boiling Oyl, which though afterwards ſwallowed, cannot in the leaſt prejudice him. It will alſo not be amiſs to purge the ill Humours out of the whole habit of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:171433:236"/>
the Child, giving him half an Ounce of Syrup of <hi>Succory</hi> with <hi>Rhubarb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If theſe Ulcers are maintained by a <hi>Venereal</hi> venome, theſe Remedies may for ſome time hinder their increaſe; but they will never be cured, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuch as are more <hi>ſpecifick</hi> to that Malady be applied, as we ſhall hereafter direct.</p>

               <p>THe Teeth which were hidden in the Jaws, uſually begin to come forth, not all at a time, but one after another, towards the fifth or ſixth Month, ſometimes ſooner and ſometimes alſo later; for to effect which, they cut the Gums wherewith they were covered. Then becauſe of the exquiſite ſence of thoſe parts, there happens ſo great pains to the Children, that many who hitherto were very well, are now in great danger of their life, and often die, by reaſon of many miſchievous accidents which happen to them at that time. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> names the principal of them in the 25. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſm</hi> of his Third Book. <hi>In progreſſu verò quum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>When, ſaies he, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren begin to breed their Teeth, they are troubled with ching of their Gums, Feavers, Convulſions and Looſneſſes, and principally when they breed
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:171433:236"/>
their Tusks, or Dog-teeth, eſpecially thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who are fat (or full of Humours) and bound.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Dog-teeth, commonly called the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth, cauſe more pain to the Child than any of the reſt; becauſe they have a very deep root, and a ſmall Nerve more conſiderable, which, 'tis ſaid, hath communication with that, that makes the Eye move: and as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> alſo ſaith, Thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which are very groſs and bound in their body, are upon this account in much more danger than others; becauſe the pains in theſe cauſeth a much greater ſluxion of humours upon the diſeaſed part, with which their bodies alway abound when they are coſtive. The Teeth which are firſt bred, are the cutting, or fore-teeth, as well becauſe they are ſooner perfect, as becauſe, being ſmaller and ſharper, the Gums are eaſier pierced through, and alſo with leſs pain, than by the reſt, which are ſofter at the begining, and being larger cannot ſo ſoon make their way, at leaſt not without greater efforts.</p>
               <p>Signs when Children will breed their Teeth, are when the Gumms and Cheeks are ſwelled, they feel a great heat there, with an itching, which often makes them put their Fingers in their Mouths to rub them, from whence much moiſture diſtills down into the Mouth, becauſe of the pain they feel there; the Nurſe in giving them ſuck finds the Mouth hotter, they are much changed, and cry every moment, and cannot ſleep, or but very little at that time; and one may feel and ſee ſmall points of the Teeth through the Gums, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear thin and pale on the top, and ſwelled and red on the ſides; and if it happens that the Teeth are a
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:171433:237"/>
long time ere they are cut, or that too many of them cut at a time, there is great danger the Children will fall into thoſe accidents mentioned by <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> in the aforeſaid <hi>Aphoriſme,</hi> and if it do not quickly ceaſe, they'l die of it, as many do.</p>
               <p>In this caſe two things muſt be regarded; the firſt to preſerve the Child from the evil Accidents that may happen to it, becauſe of the great pain; and the ſecond, to aſſiſt as much as may be, the cutting of the Teeth, when they can hardly cut the Gums themſelves.</p>
               <p>To prevent theſe Accidents to the Child, the Nurſe muſt keep a good Diet, and uſe all things that may cool and temper her Milk, that a Fever may not follow the pain of the Teeth; and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Humours may not fall too-abundantly upon the inflamed Gums, keep the Childs Belly alwaies looſe, to empty them downward, to which purpoſe give him gentle Clyſters, if he be bound; but there is often no need of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at that time they are uſually troubled with a Looſneſs.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond, which helps the cutting of the Teeth, that the Nurſe muſt do from time to time, who muſt paſs her Finger upon the Childs Gums, gently rubbing them, that being thereby rarefied, they may be the eaſier penetrated, and cut by the Teeth, which are ready to come forth; to which alſo the Child may it ſelf be helpful, if they give it a little ſtick of <hi>Liquorice</hi> to champ, or a little end of a ſmall new wax-candle, which is very good to ſoften the Gum. There is ordinarily made uſe of a Silver Coral, furniſhed with ſmall Bells, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Child from the pain it then feels. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:171433:237"/>
inſtead of Coral, they put a Wolfs tooth in. One muſt not however believe that theſe things have any peculiar property, as many Women imagine; but if they are helpful in this caſe, it is becauſe of their ſolidity, evenneſs and ſmoothneſs; for the Child rubbing the Gums with it, to eaſe the itching which it feels there, doth by degrees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the thickneſs of them, and ſo they are at length inſenſibly cut by the Teeth which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. If theſe things do no good, becauſe the Gums are either too-hard or too-thick, that the Child may not ſuffer ſo much, nor, by reaſon of the great pain, fall into thoſe accidents by us above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, let the Gums be cut with a Lancet, where the Teeth are ready; Nurſes uſe to do it with their Nails, but 'tis better to be done with<note n="*" place="margin">A thin Groat is as good or better than either.</note> a Lancet, becauſe 'tis not ſo painful.</p>
               <p>There are many Remedies, which divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aſſert have a peculiar property to help the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Teeth, as rubbing them with Bitches milk, Hares or Pigs brains, and hanging a Vipers tooth about the Neck of the Child, and other ſuch like trifles; but ſince they are founded more on Superſtition, than any reaſon, I will not trouble my ſelf to enlarge upon what is ſo uſeleſs.</p>

               <p>For the moſt part the Looſneſſes happen to them by reaſon of the great pain they have at the cutting their Teeth; for all the Humours are ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated, that they are then very thirſty, which makes them, endeavouring to extinguiſh it, draw more Milk than their weak Stomachs can digeſt, which corrupting there, a Looſneſs certainly follows. It may alſo happen by the vitiouſneſs of the Nurſes Milk, which may be too hot, (as a new-laid Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans alſo is) being ever impure, eſpecially the firſt five or ſix daies.</p>
               <p>If the Looſneſs be not accompanied with a Fever or ſome other accident, it is not dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an indiſpoſition convenient to a Childs
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:171433:238"/>
nature and moiſt habit, as alſo to the food where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is nouriſhed. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> aſſures us as much in the four and thirtieth Aphoriſm of his ſecond Book. <hi>In morbis minus periclitantur quorum naturae, aut aetati, aut tempori morbus magis cognatus fuerit, quam quibus in nullo horum cognatus fuerit.</hi> 
                  <q>They, ſaies he, are in leſs danger, whoſe mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are more familiar and convenient to their Nature and Temperament, or their Age, Cuſtom of living, or the Seaſon, than they whoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe hath no reſpect to any of theſe things.</q> But however, if it continues too-long it will not be amiſs to remedy it, leſt the Child compoſed of a tender and ſoft ſubſtance (eaſie upon this account, if one may ſo ſay, to be melted) be not too-much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled by it, becauſe of the great diſſipation of ſpirits, which the continual evacuation of humours flowing through the Belly effects.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe let it ſuck well purified Milk, giving it but little at a time, to the end it may the better digeſt it; and to cleanſe his Stomach and Guts of the ill humours, which being contained in, and cleaving to them, will yet ſo much the more hinder the digeſtion, give it a flight Infuſion of <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> or a little compound Syrup of <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory:</hi> gentle <hi>Anodine</hi> Clyſters may likewiſe be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, made with Milk, Yolks of Eggs, and Honey of <hi>Violets;</hi> and after purging, let them be made with <hi>Plantane</hi> water. One may then alſo mix the Yolk of an Egg in the Pap he eats; rub the Belly with Oile of Quinces, and lay upon his Stomack Compreſſes dipt in Red-wine, wherein <hi>Provence</hi>-Roſes are boiled; ever having reſpect above all to the cauſe of the Looſneſs, and the Accidents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated

                  <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> Of Vomitings in Children.</head>
               <p>ONe need not wonder at the Vomiting of little Children, becauſe 'tis an accident more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and common to them than any other; nor need one be very careful to ſtop it, unleſs it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, and a little exceſſive; in which caſe 'tis fit to remedy it, to prevent the conſequents of a worſe Malady.</p>
               <p>Vomiting uſually happens to Children, becauſe they often draw more Milk than their little Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach can eaſily contain or digeſt, with which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-charged, they are obliged to caſt it up: it may alſo happen to them, becauſe 'tis bad Milk. The efforts of a violent Cough may cauſe the ſame thing, which alſo may be effected by their Nurſes too rude dancing them in their arms, ſhaking them too much by violent rocking their Cradle; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as by thoſe motions the Milk, being too-much agitated and diſturbed in the Stomack, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well digeſted; but very often alſo, becauſe it cannot be well contained in it, the Infants Belly being too much compreſſed and ſwathed with his Swathes and Blankets in which he is ſwadled, which makes him throw it up, becauſe of the pain he feels. To all theſe cauſes the ſweetneſs and
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:171433:239"/>
luke-warmneſs of the Milk, wherewith the Infant is nouriſhed, contributes much.</p>
               <p>When the Vomiting is too-frequent, 'tis fit it ſhould be ſtop'd, leſt by the Infants continual rejection of the Nouriſhment, he becomes extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakned for want of Food; and poſſibly the action of the Stomach ſo perverted, that it can hardly be re-eſtabliſhed after that this Action is turned into an habit.</p>
               <p>To cure this Vomiting, regard muſt be had to that which cauſeth it: as, when the Child ſucks more than it ſhould, the Nurſe muſt not give it ſo much, and but little at a time, that the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach may the eaſier contain and digeſt what it receives: if it be the ill quality of the Milk, the Nurſe muſt be changed for a better; if by a Cough, it muſt be helped by things fit to appeaſe it, according to the different cauſes wherewith it is excited. The Nurſe muſt not dance it ſo rudely, nor rock it ſo fiercely after it hath ſucked, that the digeſtion of the Milk may not be hindered by theſe agitations. Care muſt likewiſe be taken, that it be not too cloſe wrapped and ſwathed upon the Stomach, but that it may be freely extended ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quantity of Milk received; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, if any ill humours be contained in it, it will be very convenient to purge the Infant with a gentle infuſion of <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> or half an Ounce of compound Syrup of <hi>Succory,</hi> and after that it hath been thus purged, if judged to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it may take a little Syrup of <hi>Quinces</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the little Stomach, having alſo upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of it for the ſame purpoſe, Compreſſes wet in
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:171433:240"/>
Red-wine, in which <hi>Provence</hi>-Roſes, Cinamon and Cloves have been boiled.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXI.</hi> Of a <hi>Hernia,</hi> or Rupture in Children.</head>
               <p>TO the end we may not deviate too much from our undertaking, which is only to obſerve ſome particulars concerning Infants maladies, we will not ſtay to explain, nor throughly to treat of all the different kinds of <hi>Hernia's,</hi> but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented ſlightly to examine thoſe which uſually happen to them, as the Inteſtinal; ſometime as compleat in Children as men, as when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine falls into the bottom of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> at other times incompleat when it doth not paſs the Groine: It may be likewiſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, though rarely, the<note n="*" place="margin">The Cawle.</note> 
                  <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploon,</hi> which makes the Rupture, and falls down alone as the Inteſtine doth; and ſometimes both the one and the other are there found together.</p>
               <p>The moſt frequent cauſes of Ruptures in little Children are their fierce Cries and violent Coughs, to which the Moiſtneſs and Softneſs of their Bodies doth not a little contribute; and alſo when they are too-ſtraitly ſwathed, becauſe their Belly (not being able to be ſufficiently enlarged, when they cry or cough much) is ſtrongly forced downwards, by reaſon of which theſe <hi>Hernias,</hi> or Ruptures, are eaſily made.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:171433:240"/>This miſchief muſt be remedied aſſoon as diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; for the longer it is neglected, the harder it is to be cured: becauſe by the continual falling of the Inteſtine, the place through which it falls, is every day more and more dilated. But as <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> eaſier happen to Children, becauſe of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of their Bodies, ſo likewiſe are they ſooner cured than in antient perſons, becauſe the parts dilated are eaſier reunited, as well by reaſon of their tenderneſs, as that the Inteſtine (being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and contained in its natural place whilſt the Child is growing) is enlarged in proportion to all the other parts of the body, and the place di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated leſſens by little and little, and cloſeth by the compreſſion of the Truſs or Swath rightly applied upon it.</p>
               <p>Whileſt Children are in Swadling-Clouts, the cure of true Ruptures, which happen to them, muſt not be undertaken, but by a Swath-band, which alone is capeable to cure both the perfect and imperfect: and is effected by a Rouler, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Compreſs or Truſs juſt upon the Rupture, after having firſt reduced into their natural ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Inteſtine and <hi>Epiploon</hi> likewiſe, if it were fallen down: To do this, you muſt lay the Child with the Head low, then with both Hands reduce it by degrees, and thruſting with one the Tumor very gently, and cauſing with the other the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine to re-enter, juſt at the dilatation, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in with it that which re-entred, to hinder its coming forth again, continuing to do thus, until the reduction be compleated, after which one muſt lay a Compreſs or Truſs thick enough upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated place, then ſwathe it on this manner: Take
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:171433:241"/>
a Rouler of breadth and length proportionable to the bigneſs of the Child, ſo that it may go three or four times about, lay then the firſt end upon the Childs Belly, towards the ſide oppoſite to that where the <hi>Hernia</hi> is, afterwards guide it under the Buttock, then conduct it in bringing it upwards over the applicated Compreſſe, bring it thence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reins on the ſame ſide quite round the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, afterwards paſs it as at firſt, continuing to do ſo 'till you come to the end of it, ever obſerving that the circumvolutions which paſs over the Groin, be brought from below upwards, to keep it the better up, and to faſten them all with ſmall Pins a top of the Compreſs, that ſo the ſwathing may be more firm.</p>
               <p>It will be very convenient that the Nurſe carry the little Infant to a Chirurgeon, to learn the manner of reducing the Rupture, and exactly uſing the Swath, inſtead of which a ſmall Truſs may be had, which will be yet better for this purpoſe, becauſe there is not ſo much trouble in removing and undoing it ſo often as there is in a Swath; for which purpoſe it ought to be waxed, or oiled on each ſide, that the Childs excrements may not rot it. Now if one would have theſe Swathes or Truſſes ſpeedily to cure the Rupture, 'tis very fit the Child ſhould keep its Bed, at leaſt fourty daies, or more according to the bigneſs of the dilatation: let care be taken to prevent its Crying and Coughing as much as may be, and that the Belly be not ſwathed too ſtrait, leſt thoſe things do again force the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine to come forth. Some before they apply the Swath, foment the part with Smiths-water, and then lay the Plaiſter of <hi>contra Rupturam</hi> upon it;
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:171433:241"/>
but this is not neceſſary, when a Truſs or Swath may be ſufficient, provided it be well applied.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe true <hi>Hernia</hi>'s, of which we have juſt ſpoken, there may be alſo falſe ones, wherein no part falls down, but only there is a diſtention of the Membranes of the <hi>Scrotum</hi> and Teſticles, cauſed by ſome matter there collected, as well through the natural weakneſs of thoſe parts, as with being bruiſed and preſſed in a bad Labour, amongſt which the watry and windy happen ofteneſt, for as for the fleſhy and varicoſe, they happen never, or but very rarely in little Infants.</p>
               <p>For the cure of the watry, called <hi>Hydrocele,</hi> which is cauſed by waters contained in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or proper membranes of the Teſticles, apply to the ſwelling Remedies that may reſolve and dry up the Waters therein, and diſſipate the wind, and afterwards fortifie the parts. They may be reſolved with Fomentations of the Decoction of <hi>Camomil, Melilot, Rue, Majoram</hi> and <hi>Fennel,</hi> in which alſo the Compreſſes to lay upon them may be dipt; they may be dried with <hi>Lime</hi>-water, wherein a little <hi>Allom</hi> is diſſolved; and after that the greateſt part of Waters are reſolved and dried away, let the parts be fortified, leſt others be there ingendred, by putting to it Compreſſes wet in red Wine, wherein Roſes and Allum have been boiled, ever having reſpect to the cauſe of the <hi>Hydrocele,</hi> and that which feeds it; but if theſe Remedies prove in vain, the Tumour muſt be opened, to evacuate the Waters by a ſingle prick of a Lancet, with which one muſt be ſatisfied in little Infants, who for the weakneſs of their Age, tenderneſs of their Bodies, and want of the uſe of their reaſon, cannot
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:171433:242"/>
then undergo a greater Operation for the Cure of an <hi>Hydrocele.</hi>

               <p>WE intend to treat here only of ſuch Scabs as have no malignity, and are only cauſed by the ſupurfluity of ſome Humors, which for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſimply over-heated, are eaſily conveighed to the Head and Face, where they make little Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in which theſe humours continuing are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and converted into matter, which after eat through and ulcerates the ſimple ſuperficies of the Skin, and drying round about the place where it came out, make thoſe cruſts there, uſually called Scabs, with which ſome Childrens Head and Faces are every where ſo covered, that they ſeem to have a Cap and a Mask of a piece, for which nothing can be ſeen, but only the Eyes and edges of the Lips, which are exempt from it.</p>
               <p>Many perſons will have theſe Scabs, aſwell as the Meazels and Small-pox, to proceed for the moſt part from ſome ſuperfluity and reſidue of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous blood, from which the Infant purgeth it ſelf after it is born; which becauſe it cannot be well rectified, is ſo driven out that it may be caſt off as uſeleſs: but it is often from the ill nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Children, who ſometimes ſuck more
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:171433:242"/>
Milk than they can digeſt, as alſo from the ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it, whence is engendred a quantity of viſcous and corrupt humours, cauſing theſe Scabs, which come moſt upon the Head and Face, becauſe they are moiſter, eſpecially in Children, than any other part of the body.</p>
               <p>Theſe Scabs may be known not to be malignant, when they are ſuperficial, moiſt and yellowiſh, and when the Scabs being taken off, the Skin appears red and crimſon, without being deeply ulcered.</p>
               <p>The courſe of theſe humours muſt by no means be hindered, by driving them inwards, becauſe their evacuation defends little Infants from many ill Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; and we ordinarily ſee them, whoſe Bodies have a long time purged away ſuch ſuperfluities, to be in better health after they have caſt forth all this kind of corruption: and as <hi>Guido</hi> ſaith very well, Though to the ſight theſe Scabs are ill, yet in reſpect of their cauſe they may be very good; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nature is thus accuſtomed to purge the Infants bodies in thruſting out theſe excrements, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours muſt only be uſed to hinder the generation of more of theſe ill humours in the Child; wherefore a healthful Nurſe muſt be provided for it, whoſe Milk is perfectly purified, and very cool; the Childs Belly muſt ever be kept open, and purged if neceſſary with a little Syrup of Roſes or Succory, that ſo the humours may not be ſent in too great abundance to the Head, nor the <hi>ſanies</hi> under the Scabs may not, eating and corroding the Skin, cauſe deep Ulcers; it will not be amiſs alſo to make the Scabs fall off, that there may be a freer vent or iſſue, for which freſh Butter is ordinarily made uſe of, rubbing them therewith to moiſten
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:171433:243"/>
them, or with the Liniment of Oile of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, laying afterwards a Cabbadg or Beet-leafe upon it, changing them twice or thrice a day, to avoid the offence and corruption of the moiſture which theſe things draw forth.</p>
               <p>Theſe things ought to be continued till the Child be perfectly cured, and no other, becauſe they do very much ſuppurate the Scabs; and only draw away the ſuperfluous humours, which ſhould in no wiſe be retained within, for fear leſt a worſe malady happen after the evacuation, of which the places will dry, and heal of themſelves; all this while the Childs hands muſt be pinned down, leſt by rubbing and ſcratching the Scabs when they itch, ſhould by irritating theſe parts cauſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, whereby a yet greater abundance of humours will flow thither.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIII.</hi> Of the ſmall Pox and Meazels in Infants.</head>
               <p>THe ſmall Pox is a contagious Diſeaſe to little Infants; which ſomtimes alſo happen, though more rarely, to perſons already advanced in age, in which abundance of Puſtules all alike do break forth throughout the ſuperficies of the Skin, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred from the impurity of the Blood and other Humours which nature there caſts out, as an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal emunctory to cleanſe the whole body of them.</p>
               <p>Many antient as well as modern Phyſicians at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:171433:243"/>
the cauſe of this diſeaſe to the reſidue of the menſtruous blood, wherewith the Infant was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Mothers Womb, which after its birth coming to be heated, and to boil in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, is ſeparated from the whole Maſs of Blood which hath been ſince engendred, and is ſpread throughout all the ſuperficies of the Body, to be in that manner rejected and expelled. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning (according to my opinion) is not very probable, for we daily ſee many Men and Women, who though very aged, have never had this Malady, which they could never have avoided, if it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the remainder of the menſtruous Blood, wherewith every one without exception is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in their Mothers Womb. They which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this opinion, reply, that though ſome perſons be exempted from this Diſeaſe, 'tis becauſe their ſtrong and robuſt nature could digeſt and conſume thoſe ſuperfluities, or elſe purge them off by other wayes, as by a Looſneſs, or in ſome manner more inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: However they muſt confeſs and agree, that this menſtruous Blood (if it were that) could not remain hid and quiet in the Body for 30, 40, or 50 years after Birth, without producing its effects, as we ſee in ſeveral that have not this diſeaſe 'till thoſe years; but 'tis much more credible, that the cauſe of the ſmall Pox is the corruption of a contagious Air, which doth principally infect and ſpoil the blood of Infants and Youth, who are more diſpoſed to it than they that are further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in years, becauſe of the tenderneſs and ſoftneſs of their Bodies, and more at certain years and ſome ſeaſons than at others, as it may eaſily be perceived every day; for in peſtilential times, the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:171433:244"/>
ſmall Pox is much more common in the Spring and Summer, than at the end of Autumn or in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The ſmall Pox doth differ from the Meazels, though they are ſo like in the beginning, that often it is difficult to diſtinguiſh them one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'till after the ſecond or third day, when the ſmall Pox, which at firſt appeared like the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zels, begins to riſe into <hi>Puſtules,</hi> and to whiten. The Meazels are cauſed of a Blood <hi>bilious</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated, which only makes red ſpots throughout the Skin, without or with but very little elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which comes ſooneſt and principally on the Face; but the ſmall Pox proceeds from a ſanguine and pituitous matter, which being more thick and viſcous, produceth many Puſtules riſing high, and by degrees growing white and ripening, after which their matter drying away, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Scabs.</p>
               <p>Of the Signs of the ſmall Pox, ſome precede and others accompany them; they that precede are a Fever, Sottiſhneſs, Dizzineſs and Pain in the Head, very troubled Urine, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs and pains in the Reins and Loins, reachings and vomitings, difficulty of breathing, frequent Yawnings, Sneezing, itching of the Noſe, redneſs of the Eyes, and univerſal wearineſs all over the Body: but when the ſmall Pox begins to come forth, there appears about the third or fourth day many Pimples riſing every where, which grow and augment as well in bigneſs as number, 'till the eighth or ninth day, during which time they ripen and whiten by degrees, the Head and Face ſwells, the Eyes are cloſed by a great flux of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:171433:244"/>
thither, the Noſe is ſtopped with excrements which there dry, the Patient is troubled with a hoarſe Voice, a dry Cough, ſore Throat and great difficulty to breath; and then all the parts of the Body are ſo ſwelled through the abundance of Pimples, that it appears blown up and monſtrous.</p>
               <p>There may be two kinds of ſmall Pox, according as it is more or leſs malignant; the firſt is that which is accompanied with but a ſimple emotion of a Fever, only ſtirred up by an ebullition of Blood and Humours, ſoon ceaſing from the beginning without any evil accident, which ripens, ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and is eaſily and ſpeedily cured; the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtules of theſe do riſe full, and the matter is white, ſmooth and well concocted, and the Infants eaſily eſcape it, if they are but well tended.</p>
               <p>But the other ſort of ſmall Pox, totally malignant, is that which is cauſed from ſome contagious and peſtilential humour; where the Puſtules are flat, brown, obſcure or livid, having ſmall black ſpots in their middle, they come forth but ſlowly, and no Suppuration follows, or 'tis very bad, ſanious, watry, and accompanied with pernitious accidents, as a malignant Feaver, Phrenzy, great difficulty of Breathing, Faintneſs, Dyſenterie, and others which often are mortal, or at leaſt malignant Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, foulneſs of the bone, loſs of ſight, disfigure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and great deformity of the Face, or lameneſs of ſome member, according to the places where theſe vitious humours are conveyed and retained. Theſe havocks are cauſed by that which all Women call uſually the Maſter-pock, which is nothing elſe but many Pimples, by their neerneſs and bigneſs joining together, and mixing their matter, which
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:171433:245"/>
being thus in great quantity amaſſed into one place, gnawes and corrodes the part deeper, than if they were ſpread and diſperſt in many diſtinct <hi>Puſtules;</hi> for which cauſe its cavity remains much more hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and deformed, by reaſon of the great loſs of ſubſtance there uſually made, and depoſiting or tranſporting this villanous matter upon the Bones or other parts, it foules them, or cauſes their other accidents, as we have recited.</p>
               <p>The Prognoſtick is drawn from the different nature, which we have now explicated: for if the Fever be ſmall, and that it ceaſes proportionably to the coming forth of the Pimples, if they be not in too great quantity, and that they ripen and whiten ſpeedily, it is a good ſign; but if the Feaver be violent in the beginning, and augments every day with difficulty of Breathing and other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, according as the Pimples come forth; if they are in great number, black, flat, dry, and without Suppuration, it is a ſign of death: beſides Infants are not in ſo great danger as elder perſons, in as much as this Diſeaſe is more agreeable to their Age and Nature, and that they alſo have a thinner and ſofter Skin, through which this matter is eaſier expelled than through theirs that is harder, and whoſe Pores are leſs open.</p>
               <p>As to the Meazels, they are never ſo dangerous as the ſmall Pox, becauſe its matter being more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, is much eaſier and ſooner evaporated, which uſually terminates in three or four daies, at the end of which ſometimes follows the ſmall Pox, which often makes ſome, as we have ſaid, take them one for another in the beginning, at which time they appear almoſt the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:171433:245"/>The Cure of the ſmall Pox particularly conſiſts in the force and vertue of nature, that endeavours to expel theſe malignant humours; wherefore it muſt be aſſiſted to overcome them as much as may be, and fortified that it may be able to finiſh the work it hath undertaken, being very careful not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it from its operation by an untimely bleeding, or a Medicine unſeaſonably given. To remedie this Malady, keep the Child to a good diet, avoiding ſolid meats all the time, giving it only Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, as Broaths made with Veale and Fowl, or a little of a good Jelly; let his drink be <hi>Ptyſan,</hi> made with cleanſed <hi>French</hi>-Barly, the roots of Dogs-graſs and <hi>Liquorice,</hi> and a few Raiſons of the Sun. If it be a ſucking Infant, he muſt have no Pap 'till he be perfectly cured; and ſince then by reaſon of his age he cannot receive Remedies often enough, nor other food at the Mouth than Nurſes milk, let her obſerve a good Diet her ſelf, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh and temper her Milk, as much as may be; let her not carry the Child into the Aire, but keep it in a cloſe Room neither too hot nor cold: for too hot Air weakens it extreamly, by greatly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and diſſipating the ſpirits; and a too cold Air drives the Humours back into the Body, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the coming forth of the ſmall Pox. Some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe it to be kept in a Bed hung round with Red Curtains, becauſe this Colour doth ordinarily move the Humours from the Centre outwards; but this often hurts the Eyes, and inflames them by its vivacity, to which alſo in this diſeaſe there happens a great flux; wherefore I believe a ſofter Colour, what ever it be, ought to be preferred; but cuſtome will have it ſo. The Infants ſleep muſt be
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:171433:246"/>
moderate, that the Humours being thereby better concocted and digeſted, the coming forth of the Puſtules may be the freer; it ought not to be to a Stupidity, for that would be a ſign nature were oppreſt; let the Belly be kept moderately open with gentle Clyſters, that the Excrements may be thence evacuated, if too long retained.</p>
               <p>But when the Small Pox is in the beginning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a great Fever, difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and other Accidents, the principal Remedy is Bleeding, although moſt Women not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Caſe do condemn it, and will not ſuffer it to be done to their Children, imagining that it would hinder the coming forth of the ſmall Pox; and if it happens that the Children after bleeding die, although it be through the greatneſs and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the Diſeaſe, they will not fail to impute it to Bleeding: but it is very certain this is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Remedy in the beginning of this Diſeaſe, for by this means all the Humours are cooled, and the fulneſs of them being evacuated, Nature eaſily comands and overcomes the reſt. As to purging, it ought not to be uſed in the beginning, leſt by the agitation it makes in the humours, Nature be hindered and diverted from doing its work; but towards the end it will be very convenient to empty the remaining impurities, leſt theſe reliques fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſome parts ſhould ſpoil them.</p>
               <p>All this while ſuch things muſt be uſed as may fortifie the Heart; as Cordials, not of the ſort of thoſe pretended Cordial and Threacle Waters, which ordinarily are made uſe of, and rather cauſe one to vomit, than fortifie the Heart; nor thoſe powders of Pearl and <hi>Bezoar,</hi> and other ſuch like
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:171433:246"/>
trifles, which many ſuperſtitiouſly believe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reaſon, to have a <hi>ſpecifick</hi> quality to this purpoſe; but the truer and more <hi>ſalutary</hi> Cordials are, the breathing of ſweet and clear Air, and wholeſom diet, with the moderate uſe of things agreeable to the Stomack, and which pleaſe and comfort it; ſuch as are Syrup of <hi>Lemmons</hi> and <hi>Pome-granats,</hi> mixed with the Childs <hi>Ptyſan;</hi> or a little Wine well allayed with Water, which is the Cordial of Cordials: if the Fever be not great, and that it is a ſucking Child, the Nurſes Milk ought to be ſufficient for all.</p>
               <p>As to outward Remedies, or application to the <hi>Puſtules,</hi> 'tis beſt to leave it to Nature, only aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as we have ſaid. And to the end they may ripen eaſier, aſſoon as they begin to appear, which is about the third or fourth day, anoint them, principally thoſe of the Face, with oile of ſweet <hi>Almonds,</hi> rubbing them with a Feather dipt in it: ſome mix a little Cream with it, others uſe only a a little freſh Butter, and others again old Hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe melted, and often waſhed in <hi>Roſe</hi>-water, and well beaten in a marble Mortar, with which they anoint them 'till they are perfectly healed: and when the <hi>Puſtules</hi> are ripe enough, which is known by the whiteneſs and itching that follows, and is uſually about the ninth day, the biggeſt of them may then be pierced to empty the matter, leſt by its too long ſtay there it ulcerates and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes the parts too deeply. This may be done with a gold or ſilver Needle, or by cutting off the tops with Sciſſers; afterwards to dry them up, anoint the Face with a Liniment made with freſh Cream mixed with white Chalk, continuing this Remedy
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:171433:247"/>
'till the Scabs be quite fallen off, uſing it Nights and Mornings; or elſe with Ointment of Roſes mixed with a little fine powdred <hi>Ceruſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To hinder that the ſmall Pox do not cauſe too great a flux of humours upon the Eyes, 'tis good uſing from the beginning ſome cooling Remedies, that, by moderately driving back, may hinder it. There is ordinarily uſed Roſe-water and <hi>Plantane</hi>-water mixed together, with which they bathe them from time to time; moſt Women ſteep a little <hi>Saffron</hi> in it; but becauſe of its ſtrong ſcent, I chuſe rather the Waters alone: The Nurſes Milk is likewiſe very good to appeaſe the pain. Care muſt be alſo taken from time to time to unſtop the Infants Noſtrils, that he may breath the freer, which may be done with ſmall linnen tents; and to help the Throat, which is alwaies hoarſe, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Syrup of <hi>Violets</hi> mixed with his <hi>Ptyſan</hi> may be uſed; and to cut the phlegm that ſticks there, give it a little Syrup of <hi>Lemmons</hi> or <hi>Pomegranats,</hi> or a <hi>Gargariſm</hi> of Vinegar and Water; but the Milk only is ſufficient for ſucking Children. Let us now ſee how a ſucking Child muſt be governed in the <hi>French</hi> Pox.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIV.</hi> How to cure the <hi>Venereal Lues</hi> in Infants.</head>
               <p>IF the ſmall Pox, of which we have lately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, be a contagious malady, it is not ſo ordinarily but in reſpect to Infants, for it is hardly
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:171433:247"/>
communnicated by frequentation to elder perſons; but it is not the ſame in the great Pox, the venome of which is ſo pernitious and ſuſceptible, that a ſingle Child that hath this Diſeaſe is capeable to communicate it, as it hath been very often ſeen, to whole families, and as well to old as young. 'Tis a ſad thing to ſee poor ſmall ſucking Innocents afflicted with ſo ill a Diſeaſe, which beſides that it makes them ſuffer the pain of a ſin of which they are innocent, it makes them alſo very often be abandoned by every one, and deſerted in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate by their own Mother her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that have this Diſeaſe ſo young, either bring it with them into the world from their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb, which may be known if ſhe were infected with it; or if it had at its birth <hi>Puſtules</hi> and Ulcers in divers parts of its Body, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally about the Belly, towards the Fundament, and on the inſide of the Thighs, as alſo on the Head: or elſe they got it ſince, and took it from their Nurſe, who is in like manner infected with it; then the firſt impreſſions will appear about the Mouth of the Child, where Ulcers will breed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the acrimony of the ill Milk it ſucks, which being its nouriſhment, will not fail to communicate its venom to all the parts of the Body.</p>
               <p>'Tis very hard to cure Children that are born with this diſeaſe, for they very ſoon die after; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their whole ſubſtance cannot be reeſtabliſhed, having for its foundation had ſo bad a principle, as the Mothers Blood infected with ſuch a venome, wherewith they have been engendred, formed and nouriſhed: but as to thoſe who have received it from their Nurſes only, there is much more hope
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:171433:248"/>
of, and leſs difficulty in their cure; becauſe the venom of the bad Milk not communicating it ſelf immediatly with its whole ſubſtance in the Veſſels of the Infants Body, doth not there make ſo great a ſpoil as in the other, where the Blood, with which it is only nouriſhed whilſt it is in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb, is conveighed to him and ſpreads, ſuch as it is, throughout all the parts of its Body: for then there is only the pureſt of this Pockey milk, or to ſay better, the leſs impure, which (being changed into <hi>Chyle</hi> in the Stomach, and purged by the Inteſtines of the greateſt part of its Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) can by mixing afterwards with the maſs of Blood, alter and corrupt it by the ill quality that alwaies remains in it, notwithſtanding the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent preparations it hath received; however the Child infected by the Nurſe can never be cured, ſo long as ſhe ſuckes it, foraſmuch as her Milk is ever infected with that corruption and venome; and the worſt is, that changing her for another, as one is obliged to do to cure it, 'tis a very great hazard if it doth not communicate this contagious malady to her.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid in general, that the cure of the great Pox is very difficult in little ſucking Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for by reaſon of the feebleneſs of their age, they cannot then neither take nor ſupport without great danger of their life, the violence of Remedies convenient for it; wherefore it were to be wiſhed, that by a palliative Cure one might delay a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat one, until they be <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> years old; but ſince there are very many who would periſh before they were ſo much as a year or two old, becauſe this filthy diſeaſe doth ever increaſe, and
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:171433:248"/>
the ſymptomes of it do much eaſier make impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon their Bodies, becauſe of the delicacy and tenderneſs of them, than upon ſuch who are more advanced in years; therefore one is ſomtimes obliged to undertake the cure, though the Child be yet ſucking. This enterpriſe is then in truth very perillous, but one is conſtrained to reſolve on it, when there is no appearance or hope that the Child can otherwaies eſcape. Wherefore the means follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore change the Nurſe, if ſhe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, for one whoſe Milk is well purified; and if it be not ſo, let her be blooded and purged, as the caſe requires. Moſt would have her, during the whole courſe (that her Milk may be very Phyſical) uſe a <hi>Treacle</hi>-water and a <hi>Sudorifick</hi> decoction; but beſides that I think theſe things will be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, I fear leſt by heating her Milk, it may prejudice inſtead of profiting the Child; and I ſhould adviſe her rather to keep a temperate and cooling diet; and that ſhe may not herſelf receive any hurt, it will not be amiſs for her to waſh her Nipple with Wine, every time ſhe gives the Child ſuck; and that ſhe now and then take a Purge, to keep her Body clean and leſs diſpoſed to receive this infection.</p>
               <p>But very often theſe poor little Children thus afflicted, are ſo unhappy, that they cannot find any Nurſe, that will by giving them ſuck, expoſe themſelves to the hazard of getting the diſeaſe: in this caſe we muſt chooſe one that hath abundance of Milk, and is ſoft milcht, to the end that by gentle ſqueezing of it, there may fall enough into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Mouth for its nouriſhment: or that by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving milked ſome in a glaſs, they may feed it with a
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:171433:249"/>
Spoon; or elſe they may dip a piece of Linnen rolled up in it, and give it to ſuck. But the beſt way to avoid the Childs ſpoiling any Nurſe, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt it from ſuch a ſubjection, is to let it ſuck a young Goat, fed on purpoſe with good Hay and other convenient things, that ſo the Milk of it may be very good.</p>
               <p>As to the Child, it is moſt certain it can never be cured of a confirmed Pox but by the uſe of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines wherein Mercury is mixed, which hitherto is eſteemed the proper Antidote to the poiſon of this Diſeaſe: wherefore after bleeding and purging him with Syrup of Roſes, or of <hi>Succory,</hi> let him, if his ſtrength permit, be a little anointed with a <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> Ointment, wherewith only the Puſtules and Ulcers muſt be rubbed, in doing which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, reiterating the unctions, a ſmall Flux will be raiſed, which muſt be almoſt inſenſible, leſt the Humours being ſtirred and conveighed in too great abundance to the Mouth, cauſe it not to ſwell too much, and breed there naughty Ulcers, which may hinder the Sucking of it: Wherefore but a ſmall quantity of <hi>Mercury</hi> muſt be mixed with the Ointment, being better to be a longer time a curing, than too precipitate: for this cauſe having uſed a ſmall Friction or two at the moſt, forbear five or ſix daies, to mark to what degree the Infant will be moved with it; and then by the effects of the firſt, you may judge whether it is neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterate them, and with what doſe, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be preciſely directed; becauſe all the habits of Infants are as well different as thoſe of men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom ſome will ſpit ſooner with one Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than others with ſix immediatly after one
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:171433:249"/>
another. But in this caſe there is nothing near ſo great danger of hurting by too little, as there is by too much: it being more eaſie to repeat and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the doſe when not ſtrong enough at firſt, than to ſtop the effects when it exceeds.</p>
               <p>One may, inſtead of Frictions, or together with them, wrap the Infant in a bed lightly perfumed with <hi>Mercury;</hi> and as to the Ulcers which breed in the Mouth, let the Nurſe waſh them with Barley-water boiled with <hi>Agrimony,</hi> adding to it a little Honey of Roſes, or Syrup of <hi>Worm-wood</hi> with white-Wine, wherewith alſo the Nurſe may often wipe off the froth which is uſually there ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; which, that he may void the eaſier, let him lye upon his ſide, and not upon his back, leſt the flime falling into the Stomach, or upon the Lungs, ſhould choak it. Let him alwaies be kept warm, without carrying him to the Air, watching diligently the effect of the Remedy, which in this caſe ought to be managed by a prudent and expert Chirurgeon, and not left to the diſcretion of every one.</p>
               <p>The common way to make this Ointment is to take half an Ounce of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which muſt be well cleanſed from its filth, by paſſing ſeveral times through a double Linnen, afterwards beat it well in a Mortar with four Ounces of Hogſ-greaſe, ſo much and ſo long 'till it is wholly incorporated; which being done, take two drachms of this Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for each friction, and more or leſs according as the Infant appears to be ſtrong and diſpoſed to be moved by it, of whom chiefly the Puſtules and Ulcers muſt be anointed, as we have ſaid. <hi>Pigray</hi> affirms, that he hath ſeen Infants cured by being
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:171433:250"/>
rubbed with Hogſ-greaſe, only ſtampt in a leaden Mortar; but it is ever by reaſon of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> from whence the Lead derives all its quality.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXV.</hi> How to hinder Childrens growing ſquint-eyed, awry, crooked, or lame.</head>
               <p>THe Bodies of little Children, by reaſon of their tenderneſs are like ſoft wax, or young Trees, to which 'tis eaſie to give ſuch a Figure, as is in the begining deſired; wherefore one muſt be then very careful that the good conformation of their ſmall Members be not vitiated for want of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct, or elſe being ſo, they may be by a diligent care reduced to their natural ſtate; now amongſt other things, endeavour to prevent the Childs ſquinting, growing awry, crooked or lame, and to redreſs any of theſe whatſoever, as much as poſſible.</p>
               <p>To prevent its Squinting, chuſe a Nurſe whoſe ſight is ſtable and right, leſt by her ill example he gets an ill habit; and as we have ſaid elſewhere, let the Cradle be ever ſo placed, that being laid in it, he may alwaies ſee the light directly before him, either of day, candle, or fire, leſt by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one ſide, he come to turn continually his Eyes that way, whereby he will be in great danger of growing aſquint: <hi>Paulus Aeginetus</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi> alſo would have a ſquint-eyed Infant's ſight redreſſed, by putting a Mask upon his Face, with
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:171433:250"/>
only two ſmall holes right againſt the Eyes to ſee through; which will cauſe him, perceiving no light but through thoſe holes, to hold his Eyes ever that way, by means whereof they will be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in a right ſcituation, and by degrees quit the ill habit they had gotten of looking aſide. This counſel ſeems good in appearance, but I believe it will be very inconvenient for a Child to follow it: beſides that the leaſt removing of the Mask, on which ſide ſoever, the little holes not correſponding perfectly in a direct line to the middle of the Eyes, the ſight will be thereby more perverted.</p>
               <p>To prevent a Childs growing crooked, awry, or lame, the Nurſe muſt ſwaddle its Body in a ſtrait ſcituation, equally extending the Arms and Legs, and ſwathing the Child ſometimes one way, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another, leſt ſwadling it alwaies one way, the parts ſhould take an ill habit. When he is laid in the Cradle, he muſt be ſtreight on his back, and not bending; and above all when the Nurſe holds him in her Arms, let her carry him ſometimes upon one, and ſometimes upon the other; for holding the Childs Legs alwaies on the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, it would be a great hazard if they did not at length grow crooked: and it is often the only reaſon, that ſo many Children have crooked Legs, eſpecially about the Knees, and this few Nurſes take notice of, which notwithſtanding is of great conſequence.</p>
               <p>When theſe parts have an evil conformation in their Figure, they muſt be helpt with Swathes and Boulſters conveniently placed, to keep the parts in a good poſture whiles the Child is in ſwadling Clothes, afterwards being grown a little
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:171433:251"/>
bigger, one may uſe little leather Boots, ſomewhat ſtiff, with which the Legs muſt be ſtraitned; and if the Foot be only awry, Shoes underlaid of one ſide higher than the other, will ſerve the turn. When the Breaſt or Back-bone are in fault, it muſt be helped if poſſible, or at leaſt hindered from growing worſe, and the fault may be hid, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Childs clothes with Paſt-board, Whale-bone, and Tinne, placed where the Chirurgeon ſhall think fit, to reduce the miſhapen part to a better Figure.</p>
               <p>Having hitherto mentioned the moſt ordinary Diſeaſes befalling little Infants, 'tis not neceſſary here to make a larger deſcription of them; for as for thoſe that we have not treated of, ſince they may indifferently happen to all ſorts of ages, they have nothing peculiar in reſpect of Children, as to the knowledg or cure of them, but only for the tenderneſs and delicacy of their Body.</p>
               <p>There now remains only for to finiſh our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, that we give neceſſary directions in the choice of a good Nurſe.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIV.</hi> Of the requiſites and neceſſary conditions in the choice of a good Nurſe.</head>
               <p>THe firſt and principal of all the qualities in a good Nurſe is, that ſhe be the own Mother of the Child, as well becauſe of the mutual agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:171433:251"/>
of their tempers, as that having much more love for it, ſhe will be much more careful than an hired Nurſe, who ordinarily loves her Nurſe-child but with a feined and ſeeming love, having no other end or foundation but the hope of her recompence ſhe expects for her pains by a mercenary hire. Wherefore the true Mother, though not the beſt Nurſe, ſhould ever be preferred before a Stranger. But becauſe there are ſeveral that either will not, or cannot ſuckle their own Children, whether it be to preſerve their beauty, as all perſons of quality, and moſt of the Citizens do; or that their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands will not ſuffer them, nor be troubled with ſuch a noiſe; or that being ill or indiſpoſed, they cannot, there is then an obligation to provide an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Nurſe, which ſhould be choſen as convenient for the Child as may be.</p>
               <p>Now even as we ſee Trees, though of the ſame kind, &amp; growing in the ſame place, being afterwards tranſplanted into another ſoil produce fruits of a different taſte, by reaſon of the nouriſhment they draw thence; Even ſo the health of Children, and ſometimes their manners, depends on the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they receive at the beginning: for as to the health of the Body, 'tis well known it anſwers the Humours that all the parts are nouriſhed and maintained with, which Humours ever retain the nature of the food whereof they are engendred: As for the Manners, they ordinarily follow the Temperament, which alſo proceeds from the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Humours, and the Humours from the Food. By this conſequence, as the Nurſe is, ſo will the Child be, by means of the nouriſhment which it draweth from her; and in ſucking her, it
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:171433:252"/>
will draw in both the vices of her Body and Mind. This appears very eaſily in Animals that ſuck a ſtrange Dam, for they alwaies partake ſomething of the creature they ſuck; being accordingly either of a mild or fiercer nature, or of a ſtronger or weaker Body; which may be noted in the example of young Lions, tamed by ſucking a domeſtick Animal, as a Cow, Aſſe, or Goat; and on the contrary a Dog will become more furious or fierce if it ſucks a Wolf.</p>
               <p>The neceſſary conditions in a good Nurſe are uſually taken from her Age, the time and manner of her Labour, the good conſtitution of all the parts of her Body, and particularly of her Breaſts, from the nature of her Milk, and in <hi>fine</hi> from her good Manners.</p>
               <p>As to her Age, the moſt convenient is from twenty five to thirty five years of age, becauſe that during this ſpace the Woman is moſt healthy, ſtrong and vigorous: ſhe is not fit before five and twenty, becauſe her Body not having yet acquired all its dimenſions, cannot be ſo robuſt; nor after thirty five, becauſe not having Blood enough in ſo great abundance, ſhe cannot have Milk enough for the nouriſhment of the Child. However ſome Women are indifferent good Nurſes from twenty to fourty, but very rarely before or after.</p>
               <p>As to the time and manner of her Labour, it muſt be at leaſt a Month or ſix Weeks after it, that ſo her Milk may be throughly purified; becauſe at that time her Body is uſually cleanſed of the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi> which follows Labour, and the Humours are no longer diſturbed with it, nor muſt it be above five or ſix Months, that ſo ſhe may be able
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:171433:252"/>
to make an end of nurſing the Child, that there may be no neceſſity to change her afterwards for another; ſhe muſt not have miſcarried, but have been brought to Bed at her full time of a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Son, for 'tis a mark of a good conſtitution; and it muſt be her ſecond or third Child, that ſhe may by experience know the better how to tend her Nurſery.</p>
               <p>As to the healthful conſtitution of her Body, 'tis the principal thing, and on which almoſt all the reſt depends. In general ſhe muſt be very health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and of a good habit, not ſubject to any diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; that ſhe come of Parents that never had the Stone in the Reins or Bladder, not ſubject to Gout, Kings-evil, Falling-ſickneſs, or any other heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſeaſe; that ſhe hath no Spot, nor the leaſt ſuſpicion of any <hi>Venereal</hi> Diſtemper; that ſhe have no Scab, Itch, Scald, or other filth of the like nature; that ſhe be ſtrong, the better to watch and tend the Child in all things neceſſary for it; that ſhe be of a middle Stature, neither too tall nor too low, too fat nor too lean; becauſe a perſon of ſuch a natural Symmetry performs all the functions more perfectly, and as is uſually ſaid, <hi>In medio conſiſtit Virtus.</hi> But above all ſhe muſt not be with Child; let her be of a Sanguine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, which may be known by her Vermilion, colour, not altogether ſo red, but inclining to white; of a firm fleſh, not ſoft; ſhe muſt not likewiſe have her Courſes, for that's a ſign that her Blood is too hot, either becauſe her Temperament is ſuch, or from ſome amorous paſſion or otherwaies; neither muſt ſhe be ſubject to the <hi>Whites,</hi> for ſuch ſuperfluities are a ſign of a bad habit; ſhe muſt not
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:171433:253"/>
be red haired, nor marked with red Spots; but her Hair muſt be black, or of a Cheſnut brown; ſhe muſt be well ſhaped, neat in her Cloaths, and comely in her Face, having a ſprightly Eye, and a ſmiling Countenance; ſhe muſt have good Eyes, ſound and white Teeth, not having any rotten or ſpoiled, leſt her Breath ſhould ſmell; ſhe ought to have a ſweet voice to pleaſe and rejoyce the Child, and likewiſe ought to have a clear and free pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, that he may not learn an ill accent from her, as uſually red-hair'd have, and ſometimes alſo thoſe that are very black-hair'd and white ſkins; for their Milk is hot, ſharp and ſtinking, and alſo of an ill taſte; ſhe muſt not have a ſtrong Breath, as they who have a ſtinking Noſe, and bad Teeth, as we have ſaid before; becauſe the Nurſe that conſtantly kiſſes the Child, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect its Lungs by often drawing in her corrupted Breath: her Breaſts ought to be pretty big, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and concoct there a ſufficient quantity of Milk, but not big to exceſſe; they muſt be ſound and free from Scars proceeding from former Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes; they muſt be indifferent firm and fleſhy, and not flaggy and hanging, that their natural hear may be the ſtronger. The Nurſe muſt be broad breaſted, that her Milk may have more place to be prepared and digeſted in, and becauſe 'tis a ſign of abundance of vital heat: As to the Nipples, they muſt be well ſhaped, that is, not too big, nor too hard, nor grifly, nor ſunk in too deep; but they muſt be a little raiſed, and of a moderate big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and firmneſs, well perforated with many little holes, for to be ſoft milcht, that the Child may not take too much pains to draw the Milk by
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:171433:253"/>
ſucking and preſſing them with its Month.</p>
               <p>If a Nurſe hath all theſe recited good qualities reſpecting all the parts of her Body, there is reaſon to preſume her Milk will be well conditioned, which may be known firſt by its quantity, which ought to be ſufficient for the Childs nouriſhment; nor muſt it be too much, leſt that not being all drawn forth, it curdles and inflames the Breaſt by its too long ſtay there; but however it is better to have too much than too little, for ſhe may give the overplus to another Child. It muſt be of a middle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, neither too wateriſh nor too thick; which may be eaſily judged, if the Nurſe milking ſome into her hand, and turning it a little on one ſide, it immediately runs off; but if it remains fixt, without running by the turning of the Hand, 'tis a mark it is too thick and viſcous: The good is of a conſiſtence between both, which ſlides off gently in proportion to the turning of the Hand, leaving the place whence it ſlid a little ſtained. As to the colour, the whiteſt is the beſt, and the leſſer white it is, ſo much the worſe; it muſt be of a ſweet and pleaſant ſmell, which is a teſtimony of a good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, as may be ſeen in red-haired Women, whoſe Milk hath a ſoure, ſtinking and bad ſcent: and to be compleat in every quality, it muſt be well taſted, that is, ſweet and ſugared, without any acrimony or other ſtrange taſte.</p>
               <p>We muſt not forget the principal and beſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of a Nurſe, which conſiſts in her good manners: wherefore let her be vigilant and careful to cleanſe the Child aſſoon as there is occaſion; let her be wiſe and prudent, not ſubject to choler nor quarrelſome; as well becauſe in the beginning
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:171433:254"/>
it may make bad impreſſions on the Child, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this paſſion doth extraordinarily heat the Milk; ſhe muſt not be melancholy, but merry and cheerful, ſmiling often to divert it; ſhe muſt be ſober and not given to Wine, and yet leſs to the exceſs of <hi>Venus;</hi> but ſhe may moderately uſe the firſt, and not totally abſtain from the ſecond, if her nature require it, provided it be with her Husband, which liberty is freely given them by <hi>Jubertus</hi> in his ſeventh Chapter of his fifth Book of popular Errors, founded upon the experience of all poor Women, who bring up their Children very well, notwithſtanding they lie every night with their Husbands; and of his own alledging that his Wife had nurſed his Children all very well, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he lay with her every night, and careſſed her (as he ſaid) like a good and faithful Husband; but ſhe muſt forbear at leaſt an hour or two after to give the Child ſuck.</p>
               <p>If a Nurſe hath all or moſt part of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions here ſpecified, as well reſpecting her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as manners, and that ſhe maintaines this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by a Diet fit for the Childs temperament, and not contrary to her own, there is then great reaſon to believe ſhe is fit to make a very good Nurſe, and to bring up in perfect health the Son of a Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In fine,</hi> loving Reader, I believe I have now acquitted my ſelf of my duty towards the Publick, in communicating the knowledg that God hath graciouſly beſtowed on me concerning the Diſeaſes of Women with Child and in Child-bed: I pray God, the fountain of all Science, that he will vouchſafe to teach you the right way of helping
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:171433:254"/>
them, and their Children in theſe caſes, and make you yet better able to conceive theſe things than I have here explained them, and that all may be for ever to his greater glory.</p>
